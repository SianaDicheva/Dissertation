Seasonal movements and economic labor movements might already be in Japan but there are various different merits for doing these movements in multiple countries.

Subway stopped and evacuated in drill. Fukuoka. (NHK) Under the pretext of an international missile passing through outer space, a country that would stop a train and force the riders to wait against the wall, from the viewpoint of a third party it'd be easy to see that "That country's ruler is using fear to control the citizens", right? ??? "At this rate we'll have to lower the budget for next year... Well, good luck with road construction. Splashing the budget around on things like drills let's them avoid having the budget lowered for the next year." First off, drills against missiles are fundamentally meaningless, that's what I think. I bet that things like missile drills will continue to rise all over the country as budget countermeasures, so the local governments better get themselves ready.

1308	選択的夫婦別姓「容認」４割超 「必要ない」は３割切る  夫婦別姓選択可になったって同姓にするって人等に不利益ないのに。 デマの歴史を鵜呑みにしてるんやろね。 明治27年まで妻は元の姓だったそうだから、同姓は日本の伝統ってのは明らかにデマなんだよな。	Should married couples have choice in their surname.  40% say yes, 30% say no need.  There is no disadvantage in keeping the same surname.  Maybe some just think it is somehow not proper.  Until 1879, the wife kept her original surname. So using the same surname is not in keeping with Japanese tradition.
202	選挙カーの名前連呼、効果どれほど？ 教授が実際に研究「選挙カーによる連呼を聞いても、候補者の好感度は変わりません。ただ、集票には一定の効果があります」  じゃあ俺は竿竹で	How effective are election campaign cars that repeatedly call out a candidate's name? Actual experiment by a teacher "Even after hearing a candidate's name repeatedly called out by an election campaign car, there is no change in one's affinity for the candidate. However, there is a fixed effect as far as gathering votes." Well, a bamboo pole for me.

Compulsory participation is an infringement of students' freedom.  Getting people who lack motivation to look at something from the standpoint of children, is a waste of time, and violates their rights.  Making them compete secures a recommendation frame.  Unmotivated losers should be food for Japanese society.  Nikkouso, Nikkouso!

1319	部活動がなくなる→日本は犯罪大国となり沈没する  そんな中でしか作り上げる社会て 部活なんて種類が少ないしその分視野狭なりそうだしその中しか選べないと学生は思い込みそう 色んなものがある中で選択肢が少ないのは若い子が可哀想	Club activities go away → Japan becomes a country of criminals and collapses. In a made up society like that there are only a few types of clubs, and there isn't much variation, and the students are under the impression that those are the only choices there are. I feel sorry for the kids who have limited choices among a wide variety of options.
1257	部活動がなくなる→日本は犯罪大国となり沈没する  かって深沢七郎は、  「戦争でエネルギーを   使うくらいなら、セックスで  消耗する方がよっぽど気がきいてるよ。」   と言ったそうだ。   それを思い出した。	Club activities stopping → Japan becomes a country of criminals and collapses. Fukuzawa Shichiro said something like "If you are going to use your energy for war, you'll find it's much more sensible to spend it on sex." I just remembered that.
3451	部活動がなくなる→日本は犯罪大国となり沈没する  無駄に声出したり走り回ったり   なんか居酒屋か作業員みたいな感じだよね、無償どころか金取られるし   この点だけでも児童労働未満だと思いますね   それに脳とか関節壊してもなんの補償もないでしょ   しかも指導者はこうやって犯罪者予備軍の矯正で社会貢献してるとか思ってるみたいだよ	Departmental activity disappears → Japan becomes a criminal power and sinks  Uselessly crying and running around  It feels like a worker at an izakaya, so far from getting rich  At this point I think it's less than child labor  Besides, I don't get any compensation if my brain or my joints break down  On top of that, it seems like the leaders think that they're contributing to society by reforming a criminal reserve army
1013	部活の強制入部 やめるべき 「自主的な活動」に全員参加の矛盾（内田良）  強制加入は体にも精神的にもよくない   だから先生の金髪も止めるべき   髪を染めるのは体に悪い	Compulsory club activity, should be ended. The contradiction of everybody participating in "activities of their own free will". (Uchida Ryo) Then we should also stop teachers from having blonde hair. Dying your hair is bad for your body.

35	都内の人気公立小学校	A popular state primary school within the Tokyo area.
2136	都内の人気公立小学校 小渕優子の息子のクラスで学級崩壊  私はジャップガキ脳を高精度でエミュレートできるので…   漢字ドリルとか算数ドリルの宿題が出るたびに「おい小渕ンコ、宿題やりたくねーからって穴あけて無かった事にできると思うなよ？ズルすんなよ？真面目にやれ？」って言われたり、学芸会とか運動会みたいな催し物のたびに「おい小渕ンポ、今日は本番だからな？ドリルじゃねーぞ？ボサッとしてんなよ。真面目にやれ？」て言われたり、休み時間になると「おいチンポ小渕ンポ、あく必殺技見せろよー。ドリルチンポ見せろよー」ってみんなに追いかけられて無理やりパンツ脱がされたり、そういう辛い思いをして毎日泣かされてる子供の姿をパッと思い浮かべる   親の不始末や罪を子供にまで擦りつけてイジメるガキというのは世の中に実在するので、上述した想像は別に荒唐無稽ではない。イジメるガキというのは、家庭内で親(大抵は母親)から色々吹き込まれてる。陰険なガキの所作を見ると親の性格がうかがえる	Popular public middle school in the city. Chaos in the classroom of Obuchi Yuko's son. I can emulate a Jap brat's mind to a super high precision, so... Whenever there was homework with a kanji drill or an arithmetic drill it was "Hey, Obuchi kid, I don't want to do the homework, so can you dig a hole and get rid of it? Don't be so sneaky? Do it honestly?" Whenever there was an event like a school arts festival or athletic festival is was "Hey, Obuchi kid, today it's for real, right? This isn't a drill? Don't slack off. Do it honestly?" When it was break time it was "Hey, Obuchi penis, let's see your special moves. Let's see your penis drill." He was chased by everybody and his pants were forcibly pulled down, and thinking of that tough daily life being made to cry every day, the image pops into my mind. There are bullies out there who will bully a child for the mistakes or crimes of their parent, so the imagined scene above is not unthinkable. Bullies generally get indoctrinated by their parents (usually the mother). If you see bad behavior by a child it gives you a glimpse into the character of the parents.

4490	ミサイル配備に攻撃型空母導入も 安倍“壊憲”政権の大暴走  憲法解釈次第で空母も持てる！ってこと？   防衛型空母（爆撃機満載）とかまたニュースピークするのかな	The introduction of an offensive aircraft carrier into missile deployment as well as Abe's "unconstitutional" regime are overwhelming. Depending on interpretation of the constitution you mean you can have an aircraft carrier? I wonder whether the defense type aircraft carrier (full of bombers) and news peaks again

1818	その重大な結果は男が原因では？ 度重なるレイプとレイプによる妊娠で追い詰められた被害者に懲役4年 司法でも行われる男の透明化、とレイプ被害女性を犯罪者として処罰するイスラム国家と何ら変わらない人権意識 男に支配された法学、議会、司法に服従させられる男尊女卑の打破には積極的差別是正措置が必要  刑事責任は行為者にある。強姦は強姦で裁かれるべきで、殺人は殺人で裁かれる。 一緒にする理由がない。 あなたは嬰児を人間として認めない鬼畜のごとき主張してる自覚ある？ これで殺人の被害者が、長年レイプしてきた義父だったらこの女性を褒め称えてたよ。	Is that a serious consequence for the man? A four year sentence for repeated rape and pregnancy due to rape, transparency of men's sexism is obvious even in the judicial system, and their view on human rights is no different from the Islamic state which punishes rape victims as criminals. Corrective action must be taken against proactive discrimination and the breakdown of misogynistic practices in law, parliament, and the judiciary system is necessary. Criminal responsibility lies directly with the person who committed the crime. The rapist should be judged for rape just as a murderer is judged for murder. Are you aware that you are the same as a devil who does not recognize infants as human beings? If this was a murder victim, this woman was applauded if the father in law had raped her for several years.

Aiming to complete a prototype from 1964. Looking for power to destroy enemy bases. I guess they were probably thinking about a war with China, but if they dropped hydrogen bombs first and blew up the missile silos then it would all be over. At the time they didn't know if the US was an ally or not, so they were probably worried.

The Japanese clothes were fluorescent red, and the venue was filled with fluorescent colours. It was dazzling.  The Tongans were half naked even in the cold.

Older brother Daisuke Yokoyama has apologised about 'Because I'm a mother'. We are in the middle of bringing up children, so why did that song make us so angry.

It is also said that at the the battle of Fancheng in Xiangyang, which marked the beginning of the end for the Sun Song dynasty in China, that the method for making them was lost. Today, we don't know if that is actually true or not. From Minmei Publishing's "Observed Traditional Chinese Heater List"
