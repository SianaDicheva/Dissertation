my dad died from cancer.  i hated my dad for being an abusive alcoholic.  i love cancer.
Granted no one died or was terribly mutilated but  I always thought that, in Little Women, when one sister burned the other sister’s only book manuscript that she’d been working on forever it was a pretty horrible thing to do.

Same, and mush. Mush was the worst thing ever. I felt dizzy and like I had to puke. So I made myself puke. For 6 hours straight. At the end, I was shoving my whole hand down my throat as far as I could (I have pretty small hands) and I wasn't even gagging anymore. -20/100, would never do again, but it's a fun memory for my boyfriend, whom I've known for 10 years but wasn't dating at the time. He can always remind me how much of a dumbass I am with drugs.
He almost didn’t have it.
issues with Krista, who hasn't written for April in a very long time and didn't seem very interested, idk if Ellen had any issue with Sarah or if she was just doing that typical Ellen thing where she kinda puts her foot in her mouth when tweeting, there's some stuff out about how it's a little cliquey on set. We honestly may never know for sure.
I've mentioned this before on one of the MixNine's discussion thread, my conclusion was that it was out of character for Hyunjin. On a relatively recent episode back then, they also had this similar problem of having too many girls on one team, so they have to anonymously vote a girl to kick out of the team.  The team had Hyunjin, Heejin, and Ryujin, the logical thing for Hyunjin to do was to vote Ryujin out (even though she's pretty good) since it'll remove her biggest competition, she considered it but eventually she didn't. Hyunjin's ranking was pretty stable and everybody inside MixNine loves her.  Soooo, my theory was that Hyunjin chose to replace Heejin since she's already her best friend and she wouldn't mind, she was about to explain it to Heejin but then apparently the PD told her to keep quiet :(  Besides, Heejin ended up 4th on the final 9, which is basically 1st considering the top 3 are locked down from the very start of the show lol.
I’ve seen that in person. I could hear the heads smack from about 20 yards away. I hope they’re ok.
I’m sorry yin
I wouldnt say they were all small schools. One I remember was Valparaso vs Kentucky and Kentucky got some pivotal calls.   a lot of foul calls against the smaller teams would be fouls where the defender hasnt fouled, things like that

I believe you can't get into COB 191 unless you've declared your degree as a B.B.A. If you're enrolled as a B.A or B.S., you'll have to take MATH 220. Not sure about taking macro and micro in the same semester; I would only try it if the rest of your classes are super chill.  From what I remember they are supposed to be totally independent, but macro was taught as the "intro" class since most people take it first.

i prefer a nice fully programmable keyboard and a MX Master mouse. its nice until you have to type in some copy, or make some labels, buttons etc and you need to type. a customizable mouse is much better for designing imo
It does get a lot of daytime light. Though usage would be mostly at night. That also being said, it has about a 3 foot inset to the wall. So the projector would be pretty well shielded from light on the sides. Imagine a giant U shape pushed into your wall that goes back.   I have no idea what to consider for a projector. Rtings makes TV purchases easy.

I live in the South Carolina coastal region and have oily acne prone skin!  I change up my AM routine but my PM routine stays mostly the same. In the AM I wash my face with water and tone with witch hazel and use a light gel or very watery moisturizer. I also switch to my summer sunscreen, which contains alcohol to help oil control (currently devout Biore Watery Essence user).  For PM, I double cleanse and use a LOT of light layers of watery lotions/mists/moisturizers instead of heavy creams, and lock it in with an occlusive sleeping pack for my last layer.  This means I don't have to change my PM routine much from winter to summer, but I do nix the occlusives because the constant humidity means that I get so sticky at night if I use them. I'm not into that!  IDK if you need advice for makeup, but definitely embrace the "dewy" look, because you will never be matte during the summers.
If you think the interface between caller and callee symmetrically, existential and universal are basically mirror images of each others. When passing a value to a function, the "receiver" promises to take any type (within the limits of the trait.) From the viewpoint of the "sender", this the receiver's type is universal. From the viewpoint of the receiver, sender has passed "some" type, an existential.  When returning values, the roles just switch. The caller becomes the receiver and the callee becomes the sender.  So it makes sense if you think the polarity of existential/universal distinction with regards to the direction of the data flow. An indeed, it doesn't make sense if you think it with regards to the call stack, because that's asymmetric.
About 2 months ago I decided to make a homemade flesh light. My invention was a pillow case in the middle of a T-shirt that was rolled up and stretched over, basically a cloth burrito for my dick. I squirted lotion into it and went ham. I put it in between two pillows so it could feel like I was smashing a sex doll I guess. I wen ham in it for a solid 15 minutes till I realized I couldn’t feel my dick. It turns out lotion soaks into cloth, so I was basically furiously rubbing my cock in cloth just pure friction. I look down and there was blood everywhere. The worst part is that I initially thought it was internal. I thought I broke my dick. My dick had a huge cut in the tip and it was red for a week. Worst thing I have ever done. Makes me cringe thinking about it.
For my service, we had to have 10 mm of hair, no longer, it really bothered me, but people used to imply i was a sissy for it.  wanted to see how westerners look at this sort of thinng .

Hm.. looking back at BF1's "War Stories", there was no French story, no German story (probably the two most prominent factions in the war), no Ottoman story.. and every single story was told exclusively from the Allies' perspective.  So even though I would welcome to be surprised and have a story from maybe the Japanese or the Italian's perspective, I highly doubt we'll see a different approach for a WW2 game.  _If_ they decide to go with the War Stories approach at all, I'm pretty sure it'll be told from the Allies' point of view again OR they'll pull off something like they did with Battlefront 2: Make you believe you're about to see a story told from something else than the Allies' perspective, only to have your character defect a couple of checkpoints into the story.

America stands by agreements when terms are met. They are researching and going through the development process of nukes. They are not allowing the agreed upon inspections.   How can we hold up our end if they aren’t holding their end while also at the same time being a state sponsor of terrorism in Syria which also violates smaller terms of the agreement.   A breach of contract terminates the contract. America has handed out money for long enough. To the whole world. Enough is enough.   Sanctions are deserved.

>esea is trash, they have been trash since its release.  I disagree.  ESEA was fucking awesome from like 2003-10 back when you could actually "play with the pros"(their old slogan they've since abandoned) in pugs.  It was cool as fuck to play pugs with guys like storm, frod, method, da_bears etc back then.  Also,  in the days before matchmaking when it was much harder to find a 5v5 pick-up game,  ESEA was invaluable.
Yeah its high time for another rewatch.

From archived post: The 155mm L/40 T7 only had a muzzle velocity of about ~700m/s.  Sure, they were big shells (43kg), but they didn't go very fast (For refence, the IS-2's D-25T puts shells downrange at 806m/s).  Now, I can't find a proper penetration table for the 155mm L/40 T7, but you can find penetration numbers for the 155mm L/45 M1 'Long Tom' [1]  Those numbers are:  500m 1000m 1500m 193mm 190mm 182mm Those sound okay, but they're for the 155mm L/45 M1. Which puts down rounds at ~850m/s, compared to the shorter L/40's 700m/s.  When you consider a 155mm firing at 850m/s could only go through 193mm at 500m, imagine how a 700m/s shell would do...  There's a reason it was only really designed for HE rounds.

“Hi Everybody!”
I am not frustrated or annoyed, I just prefer to be direct in encouraging you to think about this on a deeper level. This sub seeks to foster _quality_ discussion, and I feel your topic needs more focus and information to reach that point. Everyone on this sub has read your exact post countless times. I don't say this to be rude, it is simply the truth, which is why I suggested a search beforehand. Personally, I would like to see conversations about this focus more on the mitigating factors that got us here—some of which I described—and less on general themes of "boo games are bad now." Primarily because I think it simply is not true and secondarily because we've all had this conversation a million times.  > I would like to suggest some sort of shovelware removal initiative but that would require objective guidelines of a "good" game.  Why? It is not up to anyone else to serve your inability to find good games. I play games a ton on my iPhone and I have no trouble finding ones that appeal to me; there are various websites and communities and likeminded people around that can help with this. Finding things you like has always required effort, this is not a bug. What you are actually asking for is the removal of games that don't appeal to you but do appeal to a _lot_ of people (who, incidentally, are much more valuable than you due to their willingness to use microtransactions), which is just not going to happen.  I don't think attempting to set rules for what constitutes a "good" game is productive or wise either. It is not possible to do so without excluding someone. There are already strict app submission guidelines for the App Store (less true of Android, as always); some may need better enforcement, some may need modification, but that should be the extent to which Apple polices the kinds of games on its platform. It is not up to gatekeepers to decide what qualifies as a "good" game, it is up to the market.  I don't quite know how you're defining shovelware here but if it's not obviously a scam there is no reason it shouldn't be on the App Store. Full stop.  The games that are "pushed" are the ones with the biggest marketing budgets and that is not new. The nature of the games is barely relevant and not remotely the distinguishing factor. Apple regularly pushes major, "real game" releases on the App Store too. Right now, they have Fortnite, Hidden Folks (come at me if you want but this is an extremely high quality game that 100% belongs on this list imo), Dungeon Hunter (an ARPG apparently), Lineage 2, original iPhone games like Magibot and Lara Croft GO, and the game of the day is an interesting looking point-and-click adventure. Just from what's being promoted at this exact point in time, there is surely something for almost everyone. If not, there is always tomorrow. Or, as I said, one of the many websites or communities dedicated to surfacing these games.  As other people have pointed out, there are other factors contributing to a shortage of "real" games, such as mobile form factor, usage patterns (if I only get my phone out on the shitter, I don't need engaging games), demographics, battery life, lack of good peripherals, the existence of things like the DS, Vita, Switch, etc etc etc. There does not appear to be a huge demand for deep, engaging games on mobile phones, and this is reflected in sales. This is a huge reason more games like this aren't on the App Store and it has absolutely nothing to do with whatever Zynga et al are doing.   >  I would argue that they don't require the same level of engagement as, say, Chrono Trigger   Perhaps this is true but so what? The people who play Farmville don't want to play Chrono Trigger, and they are made by different developers with different priorities. You do not need to be intently focused to play a video game and I'm not sure why you care about this specifically. Ultimately, different markets are being served but not in a way that excludes you or that prevents other games being made. Zynga has never made "real" games, so you haven't lost a thing from this.

There are some truly unplayable cards on the reserved list, mostly from the Ice Age and Mirage era when everything that wasn't reprinted was added to the reserved list and all those shitty cards weren't reprinted specifically because they were so god-damn atrocious.  Most of the EDH playable cards are already a buck or two. If you're picking up something like Recycle or Cadaverous Bloom then its ok, but wouldn't you rather just have something you can play now rather than hoping you hit the lottery in 5 years that demand is still there and the reserve list still exists and its gone up enough that selling it is even worthwhile? If you're picking up pure junk like Apocalypse Chime then its absolutely a no.
My wife and I discover the same thing after every argument: we both love each other very much and once the smoke clears we realize one or both of us felt a distance that isn’t normally there and feel inclsecure about the relationship. Every time. Yet it still happens. There will always be trouble in a relationship. That trouble comes down to humans having trouble being humans. Commit to being a team and finding out how to solve this. Avoid all attempts to justify your feelings. Instead, acknowledge them and turn immediately to what can be done about it. See where that takes you.
Haha nice, didn't know that, I don't lurk on /r9k/

Not quite.  It's part of it, but they're not exclusive.

They want bandwagons to bring in their billions.
"So, you ... illegally downloaded the movie  'taxi driver'? Is that right?"  "That's right. But i wanted to see it with Friends, and i had no money."  "Okay, okay, cool, cool" said the Demon who was my judge. He looked again at the list of my sins.  "Er... Next sin, you had a little car accident and didn't left a note on the other car?"  "I left a note, but it was a windy day and it flew away. I paid later for the damage, when the police found me to a Security camera."  "Oh, thats good, very good..." The Demon seemed a bit confused. His eyes were sleepy and his voice unexited. He grabbed my file again and almost set it on fire.  "Well, yeah i think we're through... Oh no you Mastur-.." he coughed. "Yeah satan said that can't be a sin anymore, or we'd get overpopulated. Yeah i think thats all."  Now i was confused. were these really all my sins? that could not be true. had they forgotten Mary? did they think that the thing with paula had been an accident? Maybe, that could be possible. But what about all the other People? Jenny, Mira, lucille, and the fifty others whose names i didnt knew.  Why aren't they on the list?  The Demon explained: "You have... 7 sins, and all of them are pretty small. congratulations, you passed the trial. You're flight to heaven leaves in 2 hours. Try the beef sticks on the buffet, they're delicous. Next one!"  I stood up from the big chair and walked over to the other People who still waited for their trial. The next Person was a thin, long guy with Black hair and a very stupid name. he left and i took his seat. My hands were shaking and an awful feeling of guilt was spreading in me. I should have told them about my victims. Someone offered me a cupcake from the small buffet behind us, but just the thought of eating almost let me throw up. I watched the next Person taking his seat and answer the questions of the judge. He had small sins like me; illegally downloading music, driving over red lights, copyright infringement. Nothing really big and nothing too terrible. Until-  "you killed 56 people, 4 men, 52 women, age between 8 and 79-"  "WHAT?" The guy was shocked. His eyes were widened in Horror and he screamed:  "i have never killed anyone!"  The Demon looked at his papers.  "Well, it is written here. I will just quickly read the whole thing, okay?" He read:  "you killed 56 people, 4 men and 52 women, age between 8 and 79. in 36 cases, you also robbed them, in 45 cases you raped them, and you tortured 12 to death. You killed 6 through stabbing them, 12 through torture, you sliced their troats in 28 cases and the rest was strangled. You took out organs like heart, liver, kidneys or eyes and ate them, you also ate the legs or arms of 14."  The guy was even more shocked.   "Thats INSANE! I never killed anyone! That is a huge mistake!"   That was right. HE never killed anyone. I did.  I was just surprised that i ate so many of them. but actually that was obvious, they had always been so delicious. The feeling of guilt had disappeared.   I watched the guy trying to explain himself, but the Demon relied on his list.  Big mistake.   His trial lasted almost 2 hours. I had to leave to get my flight to heaven, when the demon said: "I'm sorry, but there's to much evidence against you. I condemn you to infinite doom in the deepest grounds of hell!"  Four demons came in and violently dragged the guy out of the room. I saw the terrified expression in his eyes. I grinned. Maybe a bit to triumphant. He realized and shrieked. One of the Demons punched him and knocked him out.  I looked after him, the one who was found guilty for my sins.
Sugou embodies the feeling of arrogance almost better than anyone else in the series. However, it isnt the worst being in the series for me. He is a piece of shit, but a small one when it comes to it
My skin seems to be dehydrated no matter what I do. Despite two months of a hydration heavy routine, I still have orange peel texture on my cheeks (although they feel smooth to the touch), while my forehead and the crease of my chin (where it meets my lip) are always rough to the touch. I'm afraid to go on differin or Retin A because the last time I tried, I used a tretinoin cream that broke me out in cysts for six months and never let up, and I'm still trying to deal with the scars.    Should I start trying different products? Are these signs that they just don't work for me, if after months of doing them every night I am still dry/dehydrated? My routine is:    Morning: wash with water, Missha FTE, Skinfood Royal Honey Moisturizing Cream mixed with a drop of argan oil, Ordinary Azaleic Acid suspension (on lower half of face) and Biore Watery Sunscreen. I was using Melano CC vitamin C for a while  but I'm not sure if that type of vitamin C actually does anything, and it always seemed to ball up/pill on me.    Evening: double cleanse with coconut oil and Cerave foaming facial cleanser. I was toning with Thayer's witch hazel and then stopped to see if it would help the rough patches and it didn't. Pixi Glow Tonic every other night or so. Salicylic acid dabbed on active acne as needed. Missha FTE followed by 5-7 layers of Kikasamune High Moist. Skinfood Royal Honey Moisturizing cream mixed with argan oil, then another thin layer of argan oil on the forehead and chin. Laneige Water Sleeping Mask and then aquaphor all over.

What's with the salt you jealous baby fuccboy? Lmfao I can see your post dripping with envy
I used to feel the same about how there is no loot on Erangel, but now that every gun is good and scopes are more common I don't really care as much.  But yeah, all the houses in the middle of open fields with no surrounding cover to approach the campers inside are just annoying. They are too easy to defend compared to most compounds on Miramar. All I do is loot the city I drop in and then run around hunting people in hills/forests for the rest of the game.
its more important tbh
dont worry. happens to the best of us
So how’d it go?
I’d love to see the source where Sony state this generation will be shorter. I await your link.......  People that believe the PS5 is coming next year don’t understand how technology or the games industry works.
This is true of transactional costs paid by producers. More-so if the tax is not universal.  However, a universal sales tax doesn't affect margins since it's calculated exclusive of the price of goods. This means the deadweight loss for a sales tax can be much lower than income tax, especially for businesses.   There are many reasons why a sales tax is better than an income tax.  1. All taxes end up being paid by the consumer, including income tax. This embedded tax is currently estimated to be about 23% of retail prices. All of the administrative and compliance costs associated with those taxes also end up costing the consumer. Sales tax simply removes the unnecessary distortion and transparently taxes the consumer.  2. Income tax requires every income earner to report to the government. This is insanely intrusive, but is also very costly. It also encourages tax evasion.  3. Income tax essentially means that the government owns the value of your labor. Nobody should have to pay to work.  4. Sales taxes expand the tax base to those that use government services that don't pay for them. This includes tourists and undocumented workers.
It’s eh. Kaneki’s VA was pretty great during the end of the second episode though. That scene was fantastic.
Means that it’s not shadowbanned right ?
There is a bit of a bell curve when it comes to sets. They start off low on massdrop, skyrocket as soon as they are actually released and people start getting them, then drop back to either retail or below after about 2-3 weeks.
Well done. Now rewatch it to notice everything you didn’t notice before :)
Roy Moore was never found guilty. He's suing the women for defamation. How would you like to be accused of something you didn't do? Please cite your sources regarding Trump touching Russian kids.

I’ve got the toolbox that was over the bedside laying down in the bed, as I just picked up the topper today, so it’s got a couple hundred more pounds than normal over the rear axle, and the front end of my truck naturally sits higher than the rear about an inch thanks to the lift
Idk how I feel about salaries needing to be higher for everyone.   Like yes effect is insane but Dallas is 11th and half their games won are without him. So does he deserve a lot more?  The reason SC2 players have more is the prize pool. Personally don’t believe you should be getting paid through the roof just because you are deemed good.   High placements and winning are more important And blizzard needs more money in each stage playoff and season playoff. That means the deserving players will get more.

Pretty cool. Grew up on what was referred to at the time as a truck farm in indiana. Joined the Navy becasue the steel mills were dying in the late 80's. Did 21 years and retired. Now I am back on 25 acres growing market vegetables and herbs. We raise layers for eggs and sell those as well.   I like the sentiments. It was great to be a part of something, but I am still happy to be back on the farm. There is nothing like standing in your own field at sunset and feeling that calm, rootedness to the earth.   Nicely done video, without being overblown Hoo-rah! type stuff.
You're conflating "being realistic" with giving up. Being realistic is knowing your strength is not in academics and going the poly route to uni, instead of struggling through JC and getting a shitty A level cert with nowhere to go. Being realistic is knowing thyself and what you can achieve and not pulling a William Hung. Being realistic is giving up on your astronomer dream and pursuing it as a hobby like I did because there's no job prospect locally. Being realistic is working smart based on your strengths built up self-awareness of what you can do in a given situation (aka practical intelligence in Sternberg's triarchic theory). Being realistic is learning how to swim in when you're born in an aquarium instead of learning how to fly.

Just to give an outside perspective, the first thought i had while reading your initial comment was that you were being quite rude on a subject you were clearly ignorant of. This is very simple stuff, that should be common sense to you when signing up sepperately for the live TV add on.   This is coming from some one who canceled their live TV add on, too. It was missing way to many basic channels for me (but i think this was mostly due to my location, in major cities you get tons of additional channels) but you definitely should have known you would see commercials on any aditional content you recieve from the live TV add-on.
How do you think it’ll hold up over time? Would love to do something like this but worried about chipping.
Its soooo different for everyone, and noone starts at the same point hence the different stories about nofap.  For example i see lots of guys on nofap that suffer from severe social anxiety, has zero self worth, discipline, confidence or motivation in life, now when they start nofap they will turn their life upside down and often experience huge benefits compared to their former self.  While other guys that are "normal" to begin with, have a social life, goals, maybe a gf and is rather satisfied with life May not notice the same mind blowing difference.  Now this is the problem with this subreddit, we are constantly feeding eachother what happens, its not superpowers, its magic etc etc.  But in the end 90% of our journeys are individual, our benefits are individual and that creates individual results
On the one hand, you’re totally right. Like I never really looked at it as a positive before. But on the otherhand I’m much more of a bottom and I get off to the other persons pleasure when it comes to sex. That’s not an absolute rule though there are plenty of things that we do that are just for my pleasure, but if it was a guy then it wouldn’t have to be just for mine. But again though like you pointed out that could be a bad thing. Hm.

Syfy channel is pretty much whatever anyways at this point - they dumped Dark Matter and Incorporated, both of which would've been easy winners if they had been aired on a better network.  Truth be told, I'm not sure how long the network itself has with the way it's being run right now - they can only sell so many ads during Futurama reruns and other decades-old syndicated shows and decades-old feature films.    I'd love to see Netflix or Amazon give The Expanse the home and the publicity it deserves.  Maybe Amazon, after Netflix just got done winning tons of acclaim for Altered Carbon.
And they called it a "foot chase" lolol
Yeah somebody mentioned it previously. Maybe he took a chance. Drug testing is random. Or maybe it’s not drugs, it’s mental or his elbow.

Is this your first project? You've set your sights high, if so.  > Are there any "best practice" names for files?  So in terms of differentiating your files, you can always come up with an arbitrary tag for your newly modified files. Yours could be KRT, for Kaiserreich Technologies, or something like that. This does not impact the load order, that particular aspect is controlled by the mod load order. You can see how your mod is being loaded by looking at the launcher and you can additionally manually set a mod as dependent on another within the .mod file.  > not knowing where tags are indicated in the code.  No worries. So when people references 'Tags' within HoI4 coding, that's the shorthand reference for a country. Occasionally, technology can be locked to certain nations (usually in mods) or set up in the nation's history file to determine what they start with. You wouldn't want the German Empire and Indochina to start on the same technological footing, after all.
Leveling them up increases their max stats but does not increase their current stats. To do that you need to enhance them in the factory. You feed them other tdolls or capsules to do that. At certain levels you can dummy link your tdolls you give them a pretty large boost in power.

Futhorc declines in England *well* before Alfred's time. He's late ninth century, and none of our surviving examples of futhorc inscriptions are later than the very early ninth. It was declining decades before he was born.  As for why I don't think wizards were commonly literate before Alfred...wizards would be unlikely to be literate without Alfred because Viking raiding in the mid 800s effectively *destroyed* literacy in Britain. It's unlikely ANYONE would be very literate at the time. Manuscript production plummets in this period, many existing ones were destroyed when the buildings that held them were sacked and the manuscripts that were made to replace them were exceptionally poor - full of errors, messy and honestly looking as though they were penned by scribes who couldn't read what they wrote.   Here's Alfred himself on the subject  "Learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could...even translate a single letter from Latin into English; I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either"  Most of the books were destroyed. Most of the scholars who would create books were dead.  We can assume that wizarding texts probably fared a bit better than Muggle ones, but that's splitting hairs. That's arguing the distinction between "every text destroyed" and "ALMOST every text destroyed". Even if wizards fared a bit better than Muggles, that's still a hell of a lot of destruction and loss.  Alfred's schools, and the requirement that all the functionaries of his court be literate, were a conscious attempt to reconstruct what had been lost and keep the culture alive. Recreating destroyed manuscripts. Translating books - not solely religious books, but also philosophy and history - into Old English (the vast majority of instruction in Alfred's court schools was in Old English) because they were "needful to all men to know"  English wizards might have known how to read and write before the Norse came. But that knowledge almost certainly took some very real damage after the raiding began...and it's Alfred who preserves it for England as a whole.  There's a reason he's called "the Great".
DUDE I FEEL YOU ON A SPIRITUAL LEVEL. I’m going through the exact same thing now except it’s my store manager that went through that transformation, I’m about to quit in a week or so too once I get something else lined up. Thank you for sharing this, it’s good to know we aren’t alone
Oh the Christmas Hooker story!!   The whole family is decorating the Christmas tree at my parents house, including my 3 yr old son. My mom is getting the ornaments out of the boxes, putting an ornament hook on them, and handing them to my son to hang. He is having so much fun, because he’s always been told not to touch the tree and ornaments in the past.   After all his hard work he exclaims “I just LOVE Christmas hookers!!” Of course the whole family is roaring with laughter, which only encourages him to keep talking about the hookers... I can’t wait until he’s old enough for me to tell him about it 😂😂😂
This remind me of the other crazy post on r/creepypms the one where the dude sleeps outside some girls house.  Sure it's not part 2?
LOL, perfect summation. I’m not a huge Arctic fan, I’m halfway in right now. So far I like this more than their other stuff personally. It’s swanky and sexy sounding.   But goddamnit do I know what you mean. Jon Theodore is being completely wasted on that last QOTSA record. That motherfucker was too tech of a drummer for The Mars Volta!! Crazy. Here you have a world class drummer, and now y’all decide it’s the time to go soft rock. Fuck that haha.   TL;DR I feel you bud.
No it didn't turn out they were deceptively edited. You do realise those people went to prison? What okeefe got in trouble for was the fact that he illegally obtained his recordings

Nothing really, my theory is that he can only skinchange into Lizard Lions and perhaps when he says no only a boy who dreams he might be discounting his abilities and doesn’t consider himself a full green seer or that perhaps he knows he will die before he could ever fully manifest his abilities. I just think it’s a possibility and a Easter egg within the book. He seemed to know a lot about skinchanging when helping Bran grow in using his powers
Well I’ll be darned! I did not know that about espresso vs. drip coffee.   Also, I didn’t realize my espresso machine makes 4 shots at once, not two... which explains a lot really.   As far as skim milk goes, the app list skim milk as 3pts/cup... I dunno 🤷‍♀️
that's just what I was thinking. the thing with kobe and Duncan is that at any point in their primes you could have taken one over the other. the same thing with magic and bird in the 80s you realistically couldn't have gone wrong with picking either of them to lead your team
I feel like we haven't seen fresh choreography from Todrick Hall in forever. Kitty Girl was fun, but I attribute that more to the location & the way it was filmed than to the choreography. When Todrick works with the usual stage, he tends to spit out the same old generic movement. And what's worse is he lacks the ability to draw out the best work from the queens.
Oh no worries, I wasnt trying to show you up or anything. I love that our coaching staff can find athletes that the big programs don't want and coach them up to be All-Americans.

Gotcha, thank you! You never feel like the screen on an iPad Mini is too small..? I guess I’m worried about not seeing the whole original comic page on the screen. I imagine that you have to zoom in and then scroll through each comic cell. Is that off base..?
who knows. Fil and arvy and probably ekholm are the only ones in this group who gave a shit. Bonino was good in the first round and then was comatose against Winnipeg. everyone else was terrible
Todrick is back  Oh, jesus gross.

Oh look at you now you think for me too and make my decisions.   A man’s greatness lies not in wealth and station, as the vulgar believe, not yet in his intellectual capacity, which is often associated with the meanest moral character, the most abject servility to those in high places and arrogance to the poor and lowly; but a man’s true greatness lies in the consciousness of an honest purpose in life, founded on a just estimate of himself and everything else, on frequent self-examination, and a steady obedience to the rule which he knows to be right, without troubling himself, as the emperor says he should not, about what others may think or say, or whether they do or do not do that which he thinks and says and does.

Yeah I wish I had setup some long entries with little 2% stakes spread around the full range of the 8000s, with the ability to bail sub 8000 for small loss, rather than having what I have now.  I had done that before the BGD for the 6k range.  But that was different, we were maxed out on RSI, *and* shorts already outnumbered longs, and people were still opening shorts on each bottom failed attempt to go much lower.  Futures were at a discount.  We're no where near that sort of capitulation yet.
I miss the days of Japanese wildcards tearing up the field at Suzuka. Could never happen the way the sport is structured now, bit of a shame really. 1998 was another great example, Haga and Nanba (both wildcards) in the top 5 and Biaggi winning in his debut.
You won’t get a “marketing” job out of college with a marketing degree, usually. And if you do it’s at Renyolds&Reynolds which is a shitty company and they don’t pay well.   If you really want to go that route, I would find ways to get certificates in CRM softwares, marketing automation softwares, and big data softwares. This is pretty much the only way to make yourself stand out immediately.   You can also go the grad school route and look into an IMC degree which is really interesting and fun. This is through communication schools though and not business. I’m specializing in IMC now as part of my MBA (not at UH).   I’m in marketing now and have enjoyed it so far, but it took me 6 years in sales and the right company to get there.   The SCM program has a very solid program with very engaging professors who can help you land really cool jobs. It pays well right away and most large companies will have a need for you.   If I were you, I would maybe look at double majoring if you have the time and money and see how much effort in each direction you want to put.   Good luck!
I’m guessing between the teams struggles and the redundancy of the gnome giveaway the appeal has dropped off. Not sure what the specific reason is but that would be my guess.

Sounds like an interesting topic. To be honest, your writing sample doesn't matter *too* much, your research interests as stated in your SoP are much more important.   You can take this with a grain of salt, but if I were you I wouldn't stick too closely to this idea of having "your field" because it can come across as too rigid, as if you don't need an education you just need funding to pursue your research. Unless your research interests align perfectly with the faculty member you intend to work with, that is.   I will say that your interests are quite strong. Transnational US history, gender (emphasis on masculinity), and the history of food w/in an imperial framework--these are all hot right now, so your interests are already more exciting than many applicants. The fact that you're passionate about these subjects and not just climbing on board the bandwagon definitely makes them even stronger, in my opinion.  I would phrase it that way: here are my interests, here's what I've done so far to explore those interests, here's where I want to go, and that's why this prof/dept/school is right for me and I for it.   In that case, your writing sample is more about proving that you're capable of pursuing those interests. Not that you've figured them out nor that you've produced PhD-level scholarship, but that you have the skills and passion and only need the resources to achieve those ends.

Killmail Slack Posting Tool before Conversion: Single call to zKill, get CREST killmail ID, and get the remaining killmail data. I can present a killmail on Slack or Discord with all the information needed to understand the kill.   Post Conversion: I'll now need database tables of alliances, corps, and names simply because ESI won't return names in the killmail feed. This is chronic throughout ESI. I don't disagree that it is more normalized but it is IMPOSSIBLE to write simple tools now. You need to do many calls to get all the additional information you'd need to present a full picture of something (especially when it is character related). And if you want to keep character and corporation data up-to-date, Bob save you cause you'll be doing a metric ton of calls as that table gets bigger (you can't get security status of character in bulk so if you care for that RIP you). Even more obnoxious is when you want to do a full market scan.. you need to make 25-30 calls to The Forge regionID to get them all because it's paged (instead of packaged in a mandatory gzipped dump). And apparently that is better than making that single bigger call.   Don't get me wrong, I think ESI has a lot of potential and we'll do some pretty amazing things with it. But you need a robust backend to support whatever tool you are developing since you need to be able to get all of that supporting data. The developers that are calling you lazy are the same ones that had to deal with this struggle when ESI came out and have those systems to support their tools. Don't take them seriously.

Yeah most big firms tend to favor hiring undergrads/new MBAs over people from industry.   From a hiring point of view you might have better luck networking and getting connections with larger consulting firms as a SME in your industry instead of shooting for smaller boutique firms.   I'm not too familiar with all the boutique firms here in Atlanta, but small consulting firms compete by having a lot of in-depth experience in a specific industry vs. the breadth that large and more expensive consulting firms posses.   So if you're looking to get hired at a small consulting firm that's specialized in an industry, you would have to have relevant experience in that industry for them to consider you as an experienced hire, otherwise they probably think they're better off hiring someone younger instead.   Not sure where you've been applying to and what kind of experiences you have on your resume, but that might be a reason why you're not having any luck. At your level, most consulting firms aren't looking for generalists and career switchers; they want specific experience either in their industry or the software they work with (SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, etc.).

This up bit fiasco has only reinforced my belief in decentralised exchanges. Why go on about financial freedom when we are empowering these centralised exchanges to have the power to make or break coins (binance) or through incompetence go broke and lose everyone's money (bitgrail).   I have been lazy for too long. Fuck the fees. I'm moving all my coins to their respective wallets, and only using dex from now on.
Yeah I’ll probably end up getting the loot and saving Ganon for the very last. In terms of the Korok seeds I’ll probably only try to get enough to expand my inventory to how I see fit

There is reasonable cause to not want to put people in significant financial harm. Especially since that affects the whole family more than just the one idiot. It’s only 3k up to 10 k I believe for individuals, but that’s still a significant amount of money.   Getting the police involved and getting a paper trail is more than enough.

If you want to make sure you’re co-oping in the same general level as your character- or in the same NG cycle for non-chalice bosses—you can always check out r/huntersbell and respond to some help requests, since people post if they’re in NG+, etc. Also you can only be summoned into chalices you’ve unlocked, so they’re not super deep chalices or anything, but cooperators *do* take a 30% hit to their health, which means you’re gonna be pretty squishy when you’re cooperating.

Well to get extremely specific, Thanos couldn’t possibly have a mental image of half the people in the universe, so the mechanic that makes the most sense to me is...  Thanos tells the gauntlet to remove half the people in the universe.  When Thanos’s mind imagines people, it includes their clothes.  Thus, the Gauntlet poofs their clothing as well.

Interest. Look for stuff you like and think about whether you would like to make it too and then practice.  But also there’s a lot of great jobs in working with people like artists, and different ways to be creative.
In Aussie Rules dropkicks used to be the preferred method of kicking - where the call hit the ground and it was kicked off the half-volley. Now it’s always kicked on the full without the ball touching the ground. It’s primarily called a drop punt.
I play squads for the majority of my online games and my line up is so one sided. It makes weekend league tough. I got Marino, Calvin, Barry, on offense and Ladainian Tomlinson is my Middle linebacker. It’s really hard for me to put up the kind of points that get put up against me.
The question going forward isn’t whether we prefer it happened or not. The question is whether we should do stuff like it again in the name of progress.  I’d warn against a technologically advanced society which has forfeited it ethics, thats basically how you create the traditional dystopia.

What does rarity deal with, the effects of the card? If so, then make water Balloons Super Rare like Extinction Even, Weed Whack, Shrinking Violet. Extinction Event is a problem **but only if you've got multiple copies on the field**. Otherwise It's a strong control card that you have to save resources till trick phase to play it, meaning less zombies you can play  If you're talking about how your idea is way too good, it is- a uncommon with the same stats as a Super Rare Minus the effect of the effecting all cards on the field with the same name. If that's your reasoning, make make Black Eyed Pea like Fraidy Cat- a 1 cost drop (thought they've got the same rarity). How about Dr. Spacetime Versus Captain Cucumber? Make Dr. Spacetime Conjure only Galactic Legendaries and a 1/3? The point is, Like it or not, Rarity values are a central part of this game and will remain a part of it until the developers decide to drastically change things. Also what's wrong with my suggestion? OP said it was too slow for turn 4, but you immediately looked at my statement on rarity and ignored the rest of my text explaining it. What about the uniqueness of the card? I'm sure many of my suggestions may be unbalanced in some way, and I'm speculating, but have you gone up against Control Flower decks before? This way the card isn't too strong early on and requires thoughtful insight on ramping it up to achieve maximum efficiency, which isn't too hard as turn 1 Sunflower/ Primal Sunflower + turn 2 Solar Winds/Sunflowers= 4 Sun at turn 2  What about my statement about uniqueness? I specifically stated I wanted this card not to be too similar to other cards and by taking away the unique ramp passive, you make it the same as a Super Rare level of uniqueness. What makes superpowers Super-Rares? The effect is strong and the cheapness of the card. Here is the difference between an uncommon and a Super-Rare, they are generally not as unique or not as efficient as other rarities. This reminds me of an earlier post comparing Zombie and Plant counterparts. Cactus to Dr. Spacetime  > Rarity has nothing to fo with how good a card is, and should not  Are you saying that cactus should have the same effect of Dr. Spacetime because rarity shouldn't make a card better than another card? At this point I'm just ranting because it's 12 in my area but I'm going to finish up this discussion.   **For you, what's the difference between different Rarities? I've looked at you reply you typed while I was making this, what makes something Super Rare and not uncommon? What do you define as the line between the rarities of them? Control decks are about having the enemy run ot of cards, and being unable to deal with you, right? So what makes Water Balloons Uncommon, instead of a Rare like Mallet?**
Nice drawing. Only critic is the left side breast and curve of the jacket don’t quite seem to match.
I ask myself whether i am truly happy as well. Every moment, even when i am with my boyf. I think of ending it with him almost everyday.

We are all hypocrites, and the more i see the flaws in others, the more i hate myself for being judgmental and petty. It is true when they say ‘you are your greatest enemy’.

I don’t get what you are saying?  I was saying that being more organized with data cabling should make no more difference than with being organized with feeders.  Once they are connected to a breaker and or patch panel you shouldn’t have to do anything to that connection/termination. So if one person can understand a neat data rack but not an electrical panel that person doesn’t really know what they are talking about.   And how does this situation make it harder to add/modify to?
Steins;Gate was the anime that got me into visual novels. Now I generally don't bother with VN anime adaptations and just read the source material instead.  Also OP - have you tried the Muv-Luv games? If you enjoyed Grisaia there's a good chance you'll like them.
Hampton Roads, VA. Okay not a city but region, most here consider it just one giant city though tbh- Norfolk is amazing looking, then Virginia Beach has one of the longest beaches in the world right next to it- It might not have skyscrapers everywhere but it’s big in actual land size and plus, it sits on America’s first colony-

As far as I know Meyers doesn't kill any NPCs, at least not any named ones.  The reason to pick Meyers over Slim, if you ask me, is that Nash gives you a pretty good discount at his shop if Meyers is sherrif.

Hello! Very true when you wrote "just keep occupied". If it can help, I made an introspection of what i have liked to do when I was young, and find that my top ones have been to draw and riding my bicycle. So I decided to purchase myself a drawing table and a new bicycle and go for the better of me. It help me a lot to stay focus. Both for the learning curve, and personel fulfillness.

I've tried to explain the same thing to people. My usual example: If I see someone about to enjoy an ice cream or slurpee or something and they were to drop it, my heart shatters (or splatters). Especially if they're older :( Like the others have said, I agree, you are an empath. It sucks to say, but creating an emotional barrier is necessary.
They still interact way more than they usually did. There was years of actively ignoring or insulting the subreddit. I think weve done a good job improving it to the point that they can comment as often as they do. Part of the reason they left that first time was how needy and entitled people got. The sub got used to the hosts reading their stuff, and started using the sub as a direct platform to the hosts. Whether the sub was praising them or criticizing them, that was clearly annoying for the hosts to have this hive of people who knew they could get their attention...   We need to just trust them to interact whenever they feel comfortable. Theyve been commenting a lot still, and even posting occasionally which is rare.  If they want to change the subreddit in any particular way, they will encourage those changes as they see fit.

haha I tried...should put it on r/shittygraphs or something.  When you first start paying a loan, you're paying mostly interest.  The more you pay on a loan, the less interest per month you pay, and it goes toward the principle.  There's a point where more is going toward principle than toward interest (the X in the middle of the graph).

Today is my day 1.  I have to conquer my eating addiction.  I'm a bit fucked up with it.  Currently 5'6" and 210lbs.  I am obese.  I have to lose 72lbs to be a healthy weight.  It's a long road ahead and I'm so scared of having saggy skin.  I can't afford surgery, and my self esteem would be just as bad with saggy skin as it is with being fat.  But I have PCOS, I have asthma, I have migraines, I am starting to walk like a fat person, my back hurts, my knees hurt.  I'm a shitshow.  I'm aiming to go for a maximum of 1,500 calories a day to lose one lb a week.

Oh I'm not using the ship for dedicated combat (trying to decide between a FAS/Chieftain/FDL) for that. It's the ship I'll be using to run around and grind engineer unlocks/material with.  The reason it has even two weapons is so that if I drop into a USS and someone attacks me or I get interdicted by an NPC pirate while hauling some cargo, I can still smoke them without having to run. All I've seen so far in those situations are cobras/vipers/asps, which I could've killed in my current AspX if they weren't cowards that run away when I started shooting at them because I had no cargo. The large hardpoints on the Conda should make shorter work of them.  It's basically spec'ed to be an upgrade on all fronts from my AspX excluding landing pad size and normal flight speed.

So the spoiler team havent trolled in the lock threads before have they? It would be such a buzzkill if it were a troll.   Even though it sounded like Paulie/Natalie struggled in the early days, they are going to be a threatening dark horse if they make it to a final. Natalie has by far the best cardio of any girl left imo, and Paulie used to be a professional soccer player so he has to have very good endurance. Rooting for Joss/Sylvia just because that would give us two new winners.

There was an article in “highest in NA history” but they were wrong. It’s been higher in places years back. There was a reddit post on that if you want to see see where and how high. Nothing to do with what you’re talking about, just the regular news bs getting called out by reddit.
> JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time, Justice League: War,  Yes, Batman is in these but he's not the sole focus of the movie. That's like saying these are Superman or Aquaman movies just because they're in these movies too. Same thing with any JL movie.  >Throne of Atlantis  Batman does appear in this one but Aquaman is clearly the main character.  >Directly related to Batman mythos.  Are you saying its a bad thing? I get that not everyone likes Batman himself but putting in the bat-family characters gives exposure to them without the shadow of Batman himself. Excellent world-building for Batman lore without using Batman.

The word "just" is problematic to non-english speakers. At least in spanish, we use words that have a close translation to "just" but when translated it has a concealed meaning and it can offend some people if they get it wrong. I'm not defending the crappy PR here, I'm just saying (ha, get it?) that they might have translated that poorly.
While watching NA I knew we were bad, but I stuck around because I love watching new NA talent get a chance to prove themselves against a more established generation. I wanted to see MikeYeung, Deftly and Licorice do well. I wanted to follow Cody Sun and Dardoch's progress and I wanted to see TSM fail (nothing against them personally, just think 3 EU players in one NA team is disrespectful to the region). Those things were enjoyable. The less native talent I see come into the league the less interest I have.   If I get to see Damonte and other NA mids and players in general get a chance maybe I'll Stan for NA again, but for my love of the region is quickly waning.

You can still catch pokemon 24/7.  You can still take down gyms 24/7.  Non-legendary raids do not require more than one, or two people.  They can be sued for the people catching pokemon, just as much as for the raids.  They can be sued for the people taking down gyms, just as much as for the raids.  It has been reported that gyms inside some parks have been closed when the park is closed. That is a perfectly reasonable way to limit the activities to normal business hours.  Gyms on public property should not close.  Public property is open to all of the public.
If you’re asking if September classes will be cancelled then probably not. Here’s the full email as well, if you didn’t get it!     Greetings:  I'm writing to you since you are enrolled in a comn4xxx course(s) this summer.  I'm unfortunately unable to confirm  whether these courses will be able to run this summer, but with the summer term set to start on May 22, IF there is no settlement soon, it is likely we will have to cancel all of our summer 2018 comn courses.  Since you MAY have enrolled in a comn4xxx course(s) in order to fulfill your last degree requirements this summer, I want to alert you to a potential Plan B, especially for those aiming to graduate this Fall 2018:   Athabasca offers fully online 4th year communication course(s) that can count towards your degree.   Here's what I know:  they are all online; you have to enrol by the 10th of the month in order to start the following month (so May 10 in order to start June 1; June 10 in order to start July, etc.); they are all 3 credit courses; and you can finish them at your own speed.  I've looked over the offerings and they all look suitable, with one proviso:  you can't  take a course you've already taken in the dept.  If you choose this option, get in touch with me so I can sign a Letter of Permission (LOP) which will serve as an equivalency for 3, 6, 9 or even 12 of our comn4xxx credits.  There are two steps if you need to enroll by tomorrow:  apply to Athabasca, and then get the LOP from me which goes to the Registrar’s Office   . If you're going to enroll for July, get me the LOP first (we can do this by scanning).  As soon as you finish the course, request Athabasca to send an official transcript directly to York’s Registrar’s Office.   I don't know about the financial implications, but if our summer course(s) end up being cancelled they will give you your tuition back.   Get in touch if I can help!  regards, mary-louise   -- prof. mary-louise craven undergraduate program director communication studies, la&ps york university
You spent $500+ on a piece of useless hardware, now you’re trying to sell it without the box because it’ll cost you a few more dollars. Not only are you extremely stupid, but also cheap in the worst way possible.
Yeah, they ain’t pussyfooting around.
From reading around, most likely. But I don't think neither sig nor holosun has ever confirmed.
Is there a set-ish schedule for how long after a hero is released do they first go on discounted sale? I know I bought Garrosh during the extra large pre-Christmas sale Dec 19 - Jan 3 last year, which was just over 4 months after he came out. That sale also included Stukov, who came out the month before Garrosh. KT was a few weeks later, Jan 16 (so 4.5 months after release). Ana was Feb 13 (4.5-ish months after release)  I keep waiting on buying Alex because I feel like she *has* to be coming up any week now - next week will be 6 months exactly since her release...but I don't see where Junkrat has gone on sale yet either :/
Maybe it sounds crazy but as far as the trade.. I got private party value on my 2011 GTI when I took it to Carmax. I had heard/read horror stories of lowball offers but they gave me a few hundred more than what I'd even hoped to sell the car for at all.   As far as buying used.. I tend to always shop nationally/regionally for the specific car I want. It ends up being worth my trouble to search out the car I want online and compare prices from as far as I'm willing to go. The best deals on the cars I want never tend to be in the same city/state I live in and it ends up being worth it.
What’s the MT payout for each?
>And they absolutely worry about solar radiation on polar routes, 12% of the annual maximum exposure off a single flight.  Well yeah, *during a solar storm*. Did you read the article? Literally the most severely exposed route during a solar storm and the result is only 12% of the already *extremely conservative* annual radiation limit?  Like I said, this is a non-issue.  Maybe it's not your fault, since even the article you quote is indulging in the standard media practice of dangling speculation attached to radiation as if it is some complex, unquantifiable fear.
Isn’t it only auxiliary ships that are built overseas?
Yep, your rank goes up with missions, except at 29 and 49 where you need to conplete a mission to remove the cap again.  I went from 15 to 29 yesterday, IDK how much more it will jump when I complete the mission. I guess 130 hours before slaying the baby abomination was a bit more than intended. :P
It wasn't that clever tbh
Yeah, it's hard being with someone who rarely (if ever) takes accountability. If you're not aware of your own instincts when a statement feels off (even if they're not yelling or supposedly saying it in a 'bad' way) you might gradually start believing their statements. This is the manipulation and unfortunately can erode the self-esteem and self-worth a lot of the more empathically inclined. I'm going through something myself but I one of the major keys in the process is learning to ground yourself, love yourself, and feel whole once again. Being your own source of love so that you're not looking for it elsewhere. That can help detract anyone who might seem a bit 'off', or at the very least you'll be in a stronger, healthier place to be able to ward them off.
>With how stupid niantic is with its implementation of content towards rural players, double accounts is necessary  You could very easily make the argument for spoofing being okay and acceptable. But is it? Of course not.  Yeah, rural play sucks. But we're not entitled to being able to play, or even being able to play the same as anyone else world wide. It's a privilege, and not one that everyone has equal access too.  It sucks, it's not fair, it's reality.
They specifically mention SAT scores as valid criterion so I’d guess high schoolers are fair game for the algorithm.
That’s honestly terrifying lol
Mandatory comment about Ben having a punchable face.
my dad said the same. i was also told it was a bit my fault for hitting him first because of his testosterone or something? So i take partial blame i guess. me and him were talking yesterday and i said that he could have killed me and he said if that were the case i would’ve been dead. Which came off as weird, thank you for the advice
killing bots on their way to the bank at wildy crater is easily 2-3m/hr
They added another season at the end (split into two) that was unnecessary and un-called for.    It would have ended with more integrity if it ended when Gus...you know.
Honest answer, I think you should just wait for the rework before playing him. It's gonna hit soon anyway, and Ryze is kinda iffy in his current state (long time mains can still make him A tier, maybe even S, but for people trying to pick up Ryze I'd rate him C tier right now). Try him out in norms to get a feel of how he works, but i dont recommend playing ranked with him rn.
With all due respect, I understand the necessity for the strict rules on Competitive Hearthstone. However, while my comment was in jest it reflected the fact that Quest Rouge having 4 attack minions would make them immune to SWP, SWD, and Shadow Reaper. In fact it would make a current bad match-up for Control Priest almost unwinnable. So this change would cripple priest, which is the only thing keeping Even Pally SLIGHTLY in check. I would expect a moderator of Competitive Hearthstone to realize that the Priest class has had a 4 attack disadvantage since beta. So by posting "As a priest main... I hate you." is just a quick and easy way to express how bad this change would be for the Priest class. I assure you that  next time I will wright an essay for a topic that can be explained in one sentence.  Thank you.

You would be fine with a 5 year old machine for 3D printing, don't worry about that. At your price point, it's really a choice between the 8400 or the r5. Both are decent choices, with the 8400 performing about 10-15% better in games today.  With that said, you're likely to be GPU limited on high or ultra in a lot of scenarios so you might not notice the difference. It depends on which games you play and at what resolution.
No, but  > Don’t finance a car that’s going to cost you $400 a month.  That's not always possible either sadly.  In the following cases, it may be required.  * Bad credit, so high interest rate.  * Really bad credit, so 'buy here pay here' used. Typically they mark up the price of the car on the cost by 5 times and throw a 25% interest rate (around here anyway). I know people who (without another option) paid $80-$100 a week for a 10 year old Honda.   Personally I think it's best to (best to worst),  * Public Transportation/Car rides/Bike/Walk  * Buy a cheap used car. Make sure it's checked out before buying it.  * Get a short loan on a cheaper car.  * Get whatever car you can get approved for at the time with hope for re-financing.  * Buy here pay here/Uber/Taxi.

I was just watching a random recommended ted talk by this guy who used to be a nazi. He was a typical white italian guy his parents started struggling and he felt lost so he started acting out and then got picked up by \(he's vague on this but I assumed David Duke?\) the leader of some Neo\-Nazi group. He ended up founding a nazi group and doing white power music and selling it and making money and then he saw the light and some friend of his was like "come apply for a job where I work AT I.B.M." and my jaw dropped when he got a job installing computers like this dude still has his white power tats he's gotta cover up and apparently no one checked his background and he just got a job at IBM.
I’m just about 2 months post BU and surprisingly started talking to a new girl already that I’m really into and excited to get to know.

So little back story here...i played w3 same time last year and fell in love automatycznie but per usual I played through nearly up to level 46 and dabbled in the Toussaint area without completeting the main quest. (It was also my first game about 3 months into my sobriety). I got burnt out basically but bought the first 3 books of Amazon 1 in polish 2 in English. Managed to read through the first two and then moved on to rs6 siege.  Onwardsly, recently with the new Netflix witcher adaptation teaser trailer I felt this burning desire to replay the game but not stress about all the side quests and grandmaster set witch hunt expeditions and play the game Au Natural....when this SHIT pops up!   I've deleted and reinstalled, cleaned the disc, check for both game and software updates hell I've even considered rebuying it but this time a dc copy. Haven't done it tho...yet. and instead here I am about to pop siege back in and suck ass at it.   I honestly am so stoked for Netflix choosing to do this and not some big time Hollywood harlequin and even more so producer Lauren Schmidt Hissrich and film director Tomek Baginski for making this happen. I'll still go back and finish the book 3 for sure.   Anyways sorry for the rant but damn what a buzzkill.

Agreed, I use Grammarly to help with spelling and my obsessive use of commas, but I find it to be a little misguided and sometimes flat-out wrong much of the time when it comes to style. That's why I always re-read and re-check myself. My style is my own, as long as I'm not making egregious errors, the checkers can shove it.

It will depend on who's "buying" the 2nd house. Most places are extra .25-.75% if you aren't living there since it will technically be an investment property if only Dad buys it and isn't living there but you will be living there but you aren't on the mortgage for 2nd place. My parents own my house because they're able to get better that marketed rates with ultra excellent credit scores so I'm currently renting/buying through them and the half percent was the case since they don't live with me and it would technically be an investment property.  I pay tax mortgage and insurance so it varies month to month but we work out that $650 even 12 months then tax return to take care of the extra odd amount for insurance and property tax or else if it's less for the year they split the differences into investment accounts they set up for their grand kids, my kids. 1st year was 600 even and then $30 for taxes. And property taxes and insurance went up slightly for the past few years now. More math crunching of we move after 5 years since my parents said they would give us full equity after that time for a new larger house of we need to.

If you want to start from the sixties look up the Marvel Masterworks series and the Epic Collection series. The main books that run through the last fifty years are Fantastic Four, Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Uncanny X-Men.

This happened in my home state of Minnesota.  There are dumbasses like this all over the place during the summer.  I live within 15 miles of about 7 different lakes and people just pull out of one and drive to the next without even strapping anything down.

Almost perfect, just shouldve been falling price for those who already have kairi/xion like me but just want better traits on my copy medals. And a better chance of getting HD Repliku. I see him there and REALLY want him but its too large a selection to realistically get him in 5 pulls
Where do you work? My evals are about 1 hour 15 to 1 hour 30 depending. Oasis SOC would be 3 hours though.
Yeah that's more the point I was making, great discipline. I know people who earn more and are constantly in debt because they live like dipshits. So it just makes me happy to see people being responsible. Fuck when did I turn into my parents..
Any suggestion na shoes around 5-7k? Daily use sana and pwede din pang running.

What's the point of seasons.  Oh yeah so you can time gate eververse.  Can you at least put *some* effort into hiding the fact that theirs no other reason for seasons.  Like how about trials ornaments, anything at all.  But I guess if it's going to be anything like the vanguard or crucible don't even bother.
Yeah I saw the same thing happen with MRAs and others on Reddit. Increasingly, online movements construct themselves by sharing the worst of their enemies' statements. Often a co-construction of two movements or tendencies.

They are listed as PVP  look for the servers that are listed as I believe PVP-F or something but they are under PvP. As you browse the official servers on the PVP side you'll see it's a PVE Conquest clearly.

I remember I stopped watching sometime around Chief accidentally burning Cortanna alive... Good times, good times.
I gave in last sunday with pms and a hangover. I  was back on track by sunday evening and did a 24 hour fast into monday evening and all was good again.  It's easy to fall off, but easy to get back on again too.  Things i found that helped me with a stall:  -Really cutting back on dairy -always meet protein goal -cutting out unecessary fat  -18/6 fasting
i realize my brand of confidence isnt "hey bby come get some fux" i dont need to puff out my chest  my brand of confidence is just understanding the situation. i talk to them normally and when the dating stuff gets involved i dont try to *act* like im confident. i follow that feeling that says "well, say this now" or "try this here" or "i think she might like you to do this."   i get out of the idea that women need to be seduced, or every single girl wants some man thats going to take control of everything.   but the best thing ive learned so far when it comes to confidence in women is just treat them equal, but when you start talking dont be afraid to disagree, but be willing to explain your own points.

Well the trade off could potentially be counted by a slash mod but then again if ips spread is what worries I'd rather take the nikana prime. But some of the exodias might make up for it (hunt and the stalker stance).    Personally I'd rather make a staff of the nikana strike. Pretty much a upgrade to the orthos p

They're effective a lot longer than that though.  4-5 years.
I usually spend 10-15 minutes deciding what anime to watch, then decide to just read a manga from an anime I've already watched.   And on that note, I finished reading the himegoto manga and its actually rly good.

“Oh yeah i got so drunk last night man remember when...”  No. You dont remember anything when you’re *so* drunk.
Yeah......lots of guys become rapey and insistent about their desire when they have been drinking/drugging.   I am sure he was focusing on his desire, and just doesn't want to realize that it had gone WAY TOO FAR.

Mine used to. It was a girls’ school in London. Actually almost all the schools I know/have worked at in the UK allow the nurse/staff to at least give pads to students (some won’t give tampons in case students don’t know how to use them and problems occur).
Me too...that scene made me cry 😢😢

It’d probably be shoto but I think bakugo would be a cool version of it if the story was exactly as it is now. Seeing your protagonist start as the strongest but than slowly watch his rival become the next greatest hero? That sounds super interesting to me and I think the story would be a lot more emotional sorta like OPM but more on bakugo coming to terms with the fact by the end of the series he’s not the number 1 hero.
Do they have to be somewhat semi realistic?  Jorginho, Fekir, Oblak. We'd be going toe to teo with City with these 3. But why just 3? We have the money, I'm hoping for Fekir, Jorginho a keeper, another forward and a CB.

>while you had a resurrection stone to use and that bullshit glitch keeps you from using it    That's not a glitch, unfortunately. You can't use your res stone if a valkyrie kills you with one of her melee combos (VALHALLA or the face-smash-into-ground thing) because Boy can't get to you in time to save you.
You mean the one where Loretta Lynch made a special exception to allow a banned Russian into the country with the assistance of Preet Bahara?  That Russian who first met with Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS - the company employed by the Clinton Team - both before she went to Trump Tower and then after?  That meeting?  Yeah.  It was a setup.  Bongino has been all over this.  Every single contact that is now "under investigation" was an orchestrated event, planned to lay the foundation for "muh-Russia."    This was a coup.  A plot to entrap and frame the opposing political candidate and it was sponsored directly from the Oval Office and carried out by Obama's spy chiefs.  It will go down in history as perhaps the darkest hour of sedition and corruption this nation has ever seen.
There's also some information on this from a lab (can't source because of reddit's rules):  Taken from [4] Greenblatt EN, Osterberg AC. Some pharmacologic properties of thozalinone, a new excitant. Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1965;7(4):566-78.  "Amphetamine has the relatively low therapeutic index of 9 for grouped mice and 30 for isolated mice. (The "therapeutic index” is defined as the ratio between the LD50 and the least excitant dosage.) The therapeutic index for thozalinone is relatively high, namely, 75 for grouped mice and 270 for individual mice. Death following amphetamine was preceded by tremors and convulsions, but these were never observed with thozalinone... Thozalinone and its structural relatives are believed to be a class of nonconvulsive stimulants.  The pharmacologic actions of a closely related congener (pemoline) have been investigated, and this drug is characterized as a central stimulant with relatively low toxicity and with activity lying between that of amphetamine and caffeine. Psychological testing in man demonstrated that this agent is unique in its mode of action in that the cortical and frontal areas of the brain are affected rather than the brainstem or lower centers. More discrete experimentation on its effect on behavior in... primates and on neurophysiological phenomena, in addition to clinical observation, is necessary to confirm speculation that thozalinone exerts its effects in a manner different from that of other known excitants.   SUMMARY: Thozalinone has been shown to possess some pharmacologic actions similar to those of amphetamine and imipramine, but with important differences. It is less toxic than amphetamine, and its margin of safety in mice is greater. The stimulant action does not progress to tremors or convulsions as the dosage is increased. The anorexigenic activity of thozalinone is more pronounced and longer lasting than that of amphetamine. There is no evidence of the development of tolerance. The cardiovascular side effects of thozalinone are minimal and analeptic actions are absent."

There was a post around March where the Mt. Gox trustee explain detailed the whole process and answered all questions.  He had to sell BTC as the Japanese law requir s to pay back in Fiat. So heißt had to selbst them. However, he said that he used a service to sell those coins in a way that doesn't has an impact on the market.  If you search for "Mt. Gox trustee AMA on reddit" you will find it.
So what m+kb is something that exists currently and is a viable way to play games, it’s not a hack or cheating. Completely different from petitioning to add or not add certain features.

The only american funds product they sell with a front-end are the A shares- their retirement dates are running basically a 40bps waiver - AAGTX 2040 is net 35bps expense right now.   all of the american funds TDF's are running waivers because they are trying to break into Vanguard Fidelity TRP  meanwhile the proprietary EJ MM is NOT running a waiver and clocking in at over 70bps for  giving you NO yield. given their TDF's , depending on the vintage have averaged between 5.5-8% returns over the last 10 years, at least you get a diversified portfolio (glidepath methodology is suspect) where that prop MM won't even keep up with core CPI or PCE- yes its only 2 years, but im struggling to justify why you would stay on the sidelines out of equities during an expansionary phase of the market cycle unless wage increase and core CPI start getting out of control and fundamentals start to deteriorate- which isn't happening
I think that the biggest issue with this is a lack of damage that your team puts out. It might do well in more brawling maps that are close quarters. If the other team chooses a junkrat and/or phara they could do a lot of damage relatively easily. All that the other team would need to do is stay at arm's length and get a pick or two.

Lol you cant build a sentry DH with a shadow set a sentry build is a hybrid of the Natalya and Marauder set. If youre going for a shadow build look up shadows mantle build.   Paragon points depends on your play style. If you want to do a lot of damage work towards uping your crit damage and crit chance and cooldown time and dex but if you rather be a tank work on uping your vit and armor, life on hit etc. Personally i do a little bit of both while leaning more towards the offensive play style. Now if youre building a farming character youll want to up all your crit/dex, movement speed and gold pick up. Its pretty self explanatory.
It’s not about simply putting a build together, anybody can do that. It’s really about minmaxing as much as possible.
I mean, he was emotionally driven and had the power to bring the dead back to life. Though that also included himself after his disciple betrayed him.  If Snoke is Plageius is he also just knockoff Jesus?
Man, fear mongering does its job...  People think that immigration and terrorism (which is negligible to be honest) are the most important issues while ignoring economy, unemployment, environment and the rise of authoritarianism (especially in Eastern Europe), which are more important issues that actually influence the lives of most people living in the EU.   I blame media for sensationalizing the news.
Its mod that prevent shooting alies and wrecks because game recognize turrets as wreck.
I didn't edit anything, for your information American Creoles are native, black AND caucasian, so if I say Native it means Native and if I say American, which you could infer as Creole, that's STILL native, in fact, even less white. He is Half-Portuguese and Half-Native as his mother is Native american. White skin is an indicative of whiteness but it doesn't indicate 100% whiteness. So yes, you are.
Hmm there's not really a direct correlation to Blade Dancer in XIV.. Here's a quick summary of the base game's DPS classes:   - Rogue/Ninja is the melee dual-wield DPS. Its damage output is average, but it has the best party utility of any DPS. Skill level is pretty easy at first & get quite more challenging at higher levels.   - Pugilist/Monk is the melee who punches stuff. Many of its skills have positional bonuses, so learning to dance around the enemy is important. Damage output is higher depending on that.   - Lancer/Dragoon is your melee polearm class. Also has positionals, but not as many as MNK. Damage output is mid-high.   - Archer/Bard is the base game's ranged physical DPS & also has decent utility at higher levels. Certain skills & damage bonuses are based on critical attacks & DOTs. Damage is mid-high depending on your crits.   - Summoner is the magic DPS derived from Arcanist (which also gives you Scholar, a healer class). Most damage is based on keeping DOTs active and summon(s). IMO has one of the more complex rotations in the game. DPS output is mid-high.   - Thaumaturge/Black Mage is the other base magic DPS, and my personal favorite. It's a straight-up damage machine, turret-style class with very little unique utility. Has the easiest rotation in the game, but the real skill lies in timing & planning your movement during a fight. DPS ranges from very low to VERY high.
What's more impressive is that the girl wasn't even in the actual storyline, instead she was featured in just 2-3 panels. And she has a name too?? ...wtf
Yes! And don't be afraid to make a situation awkward by leaving without a good reason. Often, in rapes, the attacker inveigles themselves into a compromising situation with the victim by relying on social norms to keep their victim from taking off. Most of the time, it's not a matter of brute force as much as a kind of weird politeness. (There's a British joke in here somewhere).
Driver probably changed his wheels at the event and forgot to torque the lug nuts after unjacking the car.
I had to do that for basically half of the 13/14 season. Watching that 5-1 Arsenal game was still magical even if it was a day late.

Thunderskill is all we have. The Tiger II H stats are BETTER now directly because of the APDS nerf and cent3 FV4202 BR increases.  The fix is simple, make APDS a decent ammo again.
In fairness his info was good for his own server.  It was his factual stance on what was about to happen with our servers is what was jacked.  And a fair amount of what he said was right.  Just suuuuuper wrong about his biggest point of attrib stone rains from bosses.  Overall, I think I'd rather have the streamlined UR system then the attrib stone rain.  Actually, I for sure rather have the new UR system.

I knew a guy that got fired by his HR rep because he refused to change his evaluation of an employee to a lower score because they wanted to get rid of the employee. He told them he would only change it under the condition that he add "under the advisement of hr reps name, I am altering my previous evaluation score" but she was like, nononono I just want you to lower it. A few days later they pulled them both into separate offices as they were coming into work, and terminated them. The owner of the company was present during his meeting and sat silently and acted like a puppet.
i was always under the impression if i wana get the most crossbred seeds, for example cloudsbreathe, i should put all with thanalan 3, except 1st i just use potting then remove and then thanalan 3, then i read somewhere u only need to use thanalan every 2nd plant, not all 8(i assume because only every 2nd plant layed down counts for the crossing), is this correct? and just any soil for the non 2nd plants?
Jiraiya isn't a terrible 7*, I would consider him middle-of-the-pack, definetly usable. His main drawback is innate dark damage on his best move, and you have to unlock it.

> I get all that and see why you feel that way. Ethically questionable for sure. No offense meant. I also am a one woman at a time that I have a connection with type of guy too. Only meant to do it once as a learning and confidence building experiment. Don’t enjoy strip clubs nor the notion of paying a ho for sex, but if I was in your situation I’d welcome an opportunity to learn hands on and try to get a positive feedback loop about sex and cut off this constant negative loop. A high end escort doesn’t have to feel trashy. I’m not suggesting go find a cheap illegal brother full of sex slaves. Willing and able professionals.    I mean if I'd find a girl worth sticking around I think she would take the time to "teach me and experiment" too, people my age tend to not have so much experience anyway. I just want someone I am attracted to and click well with and who is attracted to me the same way.    > I mean are you able to at least befriend females ?   to be honest, no, not anymore. I used to have no problems with such things but all the negative feedback regarding my height in particular made me kind of socially anxious and that's such bad feedback loop that I am not being able to really get out of right now
It is easy to solve that problem - prove to the cat that you’re infact a fully capable hunter. The easiest way to do that is by brining it raw meat or live prey.

Haha. Was it “no u”.
This looks very nice and simple!  Might I suggest tightening the size of your drop shadows?  I feel that drop shadows spread so wide and thin begin to muddy the look of the background, and they don't seem directly defined by the foreground elements.  I also feel like the title text on the cards should be nudged down a few pixels, as they seem a bit too close to the pictures.  Lastly, this is totally optional, but something you could do to give the whole thing a slightly more completed look would be to use a color just a touch darker than white for the background, like #f5f5f5, and then apply some -barely visible- noise.  This will give the background some texture and make your foreground elements pop just a bit more.  Anyways, it looks nice and functional.  Great job!

Unlike that other commenter i heard about an internet radio station that specializes in big band/beautiful music station called radio dismuke possibly based in Dallas Texas, but that station needs our help. Soft music is making a comeback. Plus as a bonus here in san Antonio kahl 103.7 is booming despite being a low watt loser(btw thier am sister station kahl 1310 is also a low watt loser) and we need to help them survive!
As a former Aggie Bandsmen the 4 way crossthrough is infinitely more difficult and impressive than sawing the horns off.
I'd have to respectfully disagree. i know it might seem like I'm biased but hear me out. Frank was everything you want in a midfielder and more. He gave you everything a midfielder needs(passing, crossing, vision etc.) plus he added on the goals of a forward. In the 09-10 season he put down 22 goals and 18 assists and somehow got overlooked for TOTY. I know what people will say and i agree that Xavi and Iniesta were unplayable at the time and they were the best play makers in the world. While all that is true so was Frank. If 18 assists(which was more than either Xavi or Iniesta had that year) doesn't make you one of the best play makers in the world then what does? If a striker had 22 goals and 18 assists he would have made TOTY no questions asked. Frank got 22 and 18 as a midfielder, we won't see that again for years to come. While Xavi and Iniesta were one of a kind, so was Frank and I think he got robbed when he was overlooked for that 09-10 season. As much praise as he gets I still think he's criminally under rated.

No he is saying benzo’s owns so much stock, like most of amazons total stock actually, that if he sells it (when you sell a stock the price goes down, when you buy stock in mass quantities the price goes up) the price would start tanking and by the time he liquidated his total holdings the price would be basically nothing and amazon would collapse.

If you are like me you just can't bring yourself to buy when you know you should because you want "confirmation of bull". So here is what you do.   1. What for the "Jesus god what a brutal dip. crypto is over." dip.  2. Begin DCA in small amounts every time it dips to a support.   3. Be happy with your average buy-in and HODL.   4. Wait for historic resistances to sell.  5. Be as patient as a capybara for the next dip below your sell price.    6. repeat
And your well-traveled culture is showing. Call it what you want, just don’t be a dick.
I am a child of agent orange. Several spinal birth defects, spinal deformities, and more. Except veterans affairs will only admit that very few problems are related to agent orange. My drs have stated that I’ve had these problems since birth but VA claims it has nothing to do with agent orange.  My father was on the agent orange list. He had several tumors removed over the years and cancers that he had surgeries for. He died of COPD and lug cancer in 2015.
Thanks for the answer! I'll definitely look for a stackable case, it looks like a good solution, and also the USB power charger seems a good idea!  About the custom case, my stuff is already inside a TV "console"\(furniture?\) where I keep all my stuff \(PS4, Nvidia Shield TV, Switch, Hue Bridge, RPi3\), but the problem is that stuff gets dusty in there pretty quickly and all those cable are still a mess even if they are not visible 😂

I agree with thoms, if you remember his house you gotta remember where it is and then google street view it. Chances of you fight clubbing a friend out of your head is extremely low as that's a fictional story and brains would not just decide "hey lets throw a fake guy in here" unless you are extremely delusional and typing a simple sentence will rule out you being extremely mentally insane.

There is no such thing as a "quick claim deed'. It's quitclaim which means you give up interest in a property. The whole premise of the situation is erroneous you need to have legal claim in the property to file a quitclaim. So the neighbors agreeing literally makes no difference as they don't have legal claim to the land. Your parents need to contact the county assessor and figure out how to purchase the piece of land or if there is an easement on that land.

GT 1030 was released to compete with the RX 550, not the other way around.   Newer architecture, modern times, longer support. The GTX 400 and 500 series just got phased out by Nvidia, last month.   RX 550 is still decent in performance, even if not AAA performance at 720p. Yes, the price as high for the card but they hard their reasons, which could be to still maintain profit, and appease the lower-ends. I would like 50W for my brother's 280W PSU computer, lower is always better.
I am really really encouraged that the Ayatollah has a sense of humor. Remember how much fun Kim and Trump had? They had some classic exchanges. Dotard is still a personal favorite of mine. But by the looks of things Trump may have even more fun with the Ayatollah. Or he may just give him the Eminem treatment.
My mom managed to raise two kids by herself, work three jobs, and get chemo therapy for her late stage lung cancer all at the same time. She fought until the very end. You wouldn’t have even believed that she was sick. She was always so strong and so upbeat even though her lungs were filling slowly with fluid and everyday was harder and harder for her to breathe.   She took great care of us and gave us all the love we could have hoped for up until the very end. She was brave and always open with us about what would happen to her.   Every Mother’s Day I donate to cancer research and I encourage everyone to do the same even if cancer hasn’t impacted your life. No one should have to live without a parent, sibling, or friend due to cancer. Let’s find a cure.   After my mom’s death, my aunt stepped up to be a mother to my brother and I. She put her life on hold to bring two incredibly damaged kids into her home even though all her kids were grown and out of the house. She gave us love and healed our broken hearts piece by piece. She’s the mother I received through circumstance and I’m so thankful to have had her too. She is also passed but that’s okay. My mom isn’t lonely in the after life anymore.   People think it’s awful that I’ve lost both of my mothers but I look at it differently. I was incredibly lucky to have been raised by two strong women even if I didn’t get to keep them. They were superheroes and one day I’ll be with them again.

To put topspin on a ball you have to hit up on the ball.  Works in ping pong or tennis but not golf since the ball is on the ground.  The other way to get topspin is hit the ball above the equator.  Lots of topspin but the ball will never get in the air.  The only time you’ll ever see a golf ball drop from topspin is if you top a ball from an elevated tee.  A ball that rises than quickly drops isn’t from topspin it’s because the ball is bad.  No dimples or cut.
As a hard Brexiteer I'm tentatively excited I may actually get my wish. Expected to lose it at every hurdle so far, tbh.
If all you're looking at is how far a team got, yes.  2014 EU teams went 2-2 with KR in groups (perfect gaming a Korean team along the way, which admittedly was the worst or second worst Korean performance ever at worlds), and that was in the year where KR was perhaps by far the strongest region in the world.   They were 1 auto away from making it out of the groups, a freak accident against Kabum, Svenskeren being an idiot, ...  Despite all that, they overall looked a million times better than 2016 EU.

I was assuming/wondering if  Dumbledore would show up and award enough points for me to win, haha! Like in the books 😂 I didn't know a lot of the answers bc I was working through it before I got on Reddit so I lost the 50 from Snape early on in year 2! Ugh! I have been going non-stop with tasks, level 14s attributes, but looks like I'm going to have to just do classes for a bit. Thanks a bunch!
coming from divorced parents my whole life, yeah i think it’s the smartest idea to just wait and enjoy life while i’m young.  thinking about how young i am, it’s not the end of the world and idk why i’m freaking out about it right now.

Good luck and hope for the success 👍👍👍
Their situation is like our sabah and sulu. the difference is that sulu didnt get help of US to take over sabah and keep it occupied.  So my view is that israel is being dick, but malaysia should not being hostile toward them. I mean, yes they are dick, but they are non of our concern and we should not meddle with it cause there are no benefit in recognizing / demonizing it.
actually i sucked with nidalee to begin with, but after around 200 games i got good with her
I didn’t make it, just stumbled upon it while I was on google.

I agree, showing emotion is a basic method of communication with your child and it can help reinforce messages, the important part for the parent is to be responsible with those emotions and to move on once the situation has been resolved and proper punishment and make-up has been deployed. Lingering resentment from parents veers into the abusive category. If you can't control your emotions (Ie. explosive anger) removing yourself from the situation and letting your partner handle the situation as mentioned above is appropriate

Not in the area but we’ve had people call or stop in and speak with the manager. Then we set up a time to shadow for a couple hours so you can see a little what the floor is like.
I got burned at a restaurant a few months ago recommending it to a friend. They had canned Psuedo Sue, and Zombie Dust on tap. I was adamant that Psuedo Sue was better, and so we tried both. The Sue was off, and I turned over the can and saw it was brewed in Lakeland. I was bummed.
Same! I had a conspiracy theory that this might be what they were planning since there's no way they'd have enough time in a normal patch cycle to implement a unique zone for all 6 main elements at this pacing. 4 zones, 4 crystals....Eureka's origin in FF3, plus some clear and consistent nods to FF5, plus Pazuzu being the wind guardian, all indicate a strong possibility of this being the case. If this boss turns out to be actually named Ice Golem then I'll consider it strong support for this theory.
I actually didn’t mind the approach as I started by downloading my gmail address book to an org file (someone has written a lisp script). Then I link names to the record in the contacts file. If I ever wanted to export a contacts list from org mode I think it would make it easier. Also I can tag records, study, work etc.   What I think I haven’t got quite right is the number of org files and number of categories. I have had similar issues on outlook in the past. I think tags need to be generic enough to apply to any record. The org files perhaps should be more specific, like school or a particular employer.  I do find myself adding quite a lot as journal entries these days, because hunting for something chronologically makes more sense to me.
Go back to the bank you set up the account and ask to set up an appointment with a commercial and possibly a international banker regarding ownership of the account or title ownership. They should give you some insights on you options while still being inexpensive before getting an attorney involved.   Do not think that a manager is a commercial banker or even a international banker each is a different field. a branch manager can act as a business banker but not a commercial or international are specific fields
Ryzen 3 1300x vs Ryzen 3 1200: only difference is higher stock clock speed   Ryzen 5 1500x vs Ryzen 5 1400: higher stock clock speed, more L3 Cache, better stock cooler   Ryzen 5 1600x vs Ryzen 5 1600: higher stock clock speed, but no stock cooler included   Ryzen 7 1700x vs Ryzen 7 1700: higher stock clock speed, but no stock cooler included   Ryzen 7 1800x vs Ryzen 7 1700x: higher stock clock speed, chips are cherry picked so they have higher overclocking potential than other Ryzen CPUs    X-models aren´t necessary for good gaming performance. You can overclock every Ryzen CPU, it´s not really a problem to run a non-x CPU at the clock speeds of the X-model. Btw there are already some Ryzen 2nd Gen CPUs, which offers a slightly better(ofc only if they´re in your budget, the cheapest one costs around 200$)
There is a recent post in /r/arenaHS where the players are commenting on a decline of player base.    I haven't played much Arena this expansion (because the new system sucks) but it sort of makes sense considering that the number of Standard games has also declined - at least when comparing with the VS reports from the past.

Possibly an Super Duty with a 6.0 turbo-diesel motor; unstoppable (unless it has emissions control, then it's stopped by the EGR cooler).
There are better heavies to train France heavy crews and there are better medium tanks in general that offers a similar play style. (Mutz, Pilot, M46 KR).
Hello, anyone here that has a dry/oily skin that has had Jawline Acne before? What worked for you? Plus points if you're male!
I’m in the hospital right now experiencing that with the LC for my second son.  I formula fed my first and am trying breastfeeding for this one. Their explanation for not being able to pump much is “the pump isn’t as efficient as baby’s mouth.” Then why does he pass tf out for hours after I top him off with formula after I “feed” him? Infuriating.

it's not even that (well Franch would've stopd BOTH goals today) it's just the team as a whole and making individual errors trying to play the "style". top to bottom but even THEN we're getting fucked by the refs every game. we won this game 3-2 and played like it but we didn't win...again.
I think early ad9s and maxons ad9003 and some memory man ones do. The original aqua puss had them too. I'm sure there are others.
I had been questionning my sexuality for a long time (convinced myself I was straight but I'm bisexual) when someday at lunch in college my two dating gay friends gave each other a farewell kiss.  I don't know why but it struck me, it clicked in my head. I just thought "they look so happy together" and a little voice in my head answered "that's what you've been looking for dumbass, took you long enough"  Now I'm more and more used to the fact and I can't thank them enough for doing this wirhout knowing the amazing consequences it would have!

> Would the magically listening snake not do most of the work if the set up is there?  That snake still has an Intelligence score of 4. The check is to properly instruct your magically obedient snake to be in a position to be properly harvested. It doesn't instinctively know how to facilitate harvesting its own poison.    > And would the harvested poison be the snakes 3d6, save for half, or be the 1d4, save for nothing, from the PHB?  That's another DM question. When using the DMG rules, poison harvested from a creature uses the same rules as the poison the creature uses. If you're trying to stick to the rules as closely as possible, than it would be 3d6 with a save for half.
No reason to stop riding young grasshopper- you just need to learn to think under pressure, and react quickly and decisively, not panic. A 3 week freshie still has panic reactions kicking in, and over time you must learn to mentally overcome them. Keith code explains the phenomenon well in his book, twist of the wrist 2.   You also need to learn how to use your front brake to the fullest. NEVER just GRAB it, you want to squeeeeze the lever, and as you feel the initial 'bite' (where the pads make contact with the rotors) now you want to quickly and smoothly apply increasing pressure up to the maximum.. A good rider can do this from any speed he's riding at in an instant. After time, it just becomes muscle memory.   Keep practicing! Good luck

Fights are one of the least important aspects of Tokyo Ghoul anyway. Tokyo Ghoul is a seinen about understanding others, among other things.  Uta finally opened up to Yomo after their fight and now Yomo understands him a little better and Uta was finally acknowledged as a friend by Yomo. They're both able to move forward.  Amon finally acknowledged that he loved Donato, that he is part of the problem in the sense that he has ignored Donato and allowed him to continue to stir up trouble, and is now determined to do something about it.  What is important is that these characters are finally confronting people they've been avoiding for so long and the character development that results from these confrontations.

I recently baited out a Fenix's teleport, then pyroblasted him. Felt goddamn amazing.
First you have to decide wether you want to focus on PvP or PvE.because both have very different lineups and even on PS it will take months to maximise a team of six heroes plus guild tech amd monster to reek the benefits of either.   So basically the END END game is having 2 full 10*, fully maxed, equipped teams (so 12 heroea in total) with possibly to maximised monsters. That task may take you a year or more to achieve evem while playing daily and maxing all events.

Difference being other EA titles usually spent 3-4 years in development before release.  >Also, you need to play Skyrim or something if you think Destiny 2 is a good game.  What the actual fuck are you attempting to go on about? Move along with this "You can't like what I don't" bullshit.

...not really. Don’t get me wrong, ME3s ending was stupid as all fuck but a singular example from the Quarian-Geth conflict does not disprove the Starchild. I see fans saying that, and it is absolutely nonsensical.   Consider a very simple analogy - someone tells you that flipping a coin and counting heads vs tails will *always tend towards a 50/50 chance of either over time*. You then take *one* flip, *one* measurement and get heads. What you are basically arguing is that a *single* example of something disproves a statistical statement that considers multiple examples over a prolonged period of time.  That literally makes no sense.  In the Quarian-Geth case, there is no guarantee that their peace is permanent, that it won’t erupt into conflict in the future again, OR that another synthetic species won’t eventually be created by someone else that then will take over the galaxy. The Starchild’s statement is a statistical one - that in every single cycle, regardless of the circumstances, eventually an organic-synthetic conflict will arise that will not be resolved peacefully. If a couple *are* resolved peacefully along the way, that doesn’t disprove the statement at all.
Dude, you were fishing for downvotes. Stop bullshitting yourself.  If you must wonder why there are so few LGBT Republicans it's because we are consistently persecuted by them in both their legislation and public discussion.  For christ's sakes; the vice president openly supports torture for homosexuals, the secretary of states considers us an abomination, and the education secretary has saught to remove protections for us in the classroom.  Once again, *we aren't going to vote for people who'd like to see us dead*.  Tell me; would you welcome those who wish to see you tortured, abused, and stripped of your self-worth into the social groups you formed solely to escape that type of speech?  If you want to complain about that forcing us to left, then fine, but your issues lies in our two party system and not those who simply seek to have their rights and dignity as *humans* preserved, which makes the only reasonable alternative the Democrats; the most liberal of which have supported gay rights for decades.
When is World coming out for Switch? When MH World 2 comes out, it will be focused on Sony's next console and with Switch not being powerful enough to run World already, there's no way PS5 games will be ported to switch.

They will release renin. The renin won't do anything because the receptor for it is blocked, so Angiotensin I, II, and Aldosterone go down. So you have a bunch of lame duck renin flying around your system without doing squat.  Like how if you take an Aldosterone receptor blocker. Aldosterone is still high. It didn't go anywhere. It's tryna do it's job but the ARB won't let it.

Real talk tho, why do downies nearly all have godlike bulking genes? It's like every single one, male or female, has a more muscular frame than your average 1-2year gymbro, and you know that none of them lift because when have you ever seen a 3x23er at the gym?                               Is that the secret to making insane gains?                           Is there a way to isolate the 23rd chromosome, mass-produce it in a lab, and administer it as a supplement?                                  Should the fitness industry abandon prohormones and SARMs altogether and focus solely on achieving trisomy?                                  Have I stumbled across something huge?

"She’s been raped and murdered for over 30 years and is just now gaining access to those memories"  This is something I don't understand about this show. She is a machine, not a person. You can rape and murder a VCR and its family for 30 years and aside from a general concern about your well being, no one will really care, least of all the VCR.
First of all, the written language is Simplified Chinese, Mandarin is a dialect of Chinese which happens to be the official spoken language. And why do you want your client in Chinese anyway?  To answer your question, the new client makes it so this is a lot harder than before. You can search for 美服汉化补丁 in Baidu and test your luck. I've seen videos on a patch being able to change the language.

Okay, now I ask these 2 things:  A) if console was 60fps, would it make sense to make 400ms lights MORE common. I’ve always thought if both platforms were 60 you could increase the speed of the game by about 100ms. Lights would be 400-500ms standard and heavies could be 600ms+.   B) How are 400ms lights an opener? Lights still don’t chain on block and it’s still blockable on reaction.   Don’t get me wrong, I dislike the amount of unblockables attacks in the game as well, but wouldn’t you say blocking is still too strong? I’m not saying give everyone 5 or some ungodly amount of unblockables but I always thought with the way the game is set up everyone should have at least a melee attack and maybe 1 ub attack. Maybe I’m wrong though.

I'm a Canadian who moved to LA. The first time I went golfing, I went to find my ball only to be horrified it was sitting near a gang of my old enemy, the Canadian goose. Knowing their weakness, I lifted the closest thing I had to a hockey stick above my head like a mid-evil sword to assert dominance. Unfortunately they called my bluff, recognized it was a golf club, and charged. I cowarded back to my golf cart and escaped, fortunately with all limbs intact and a goose shit free golf cart. RIP favorite golf ball, RIP.
Hmm.  My GTX670 was capable of like High 1440p and maintained 60FPS most of the time. So quite odd.

True, but that's not the point. Lorenzo is STILL one of the best riders on the grid, Kalio or Iannone will never be. MotoGP is about having the right rider to win you titles.   Iannone will never win a MotoGP title, whichever bike he's on. Neither will Kalio. But Lorenzo might, its a bit unlikely but its still possible.
Subbed to both. Have some insight. The other sub tends to get a lot more DM and player advice threads. So you'll see that kind of thing more often. But the big problem communities are the smaller ones on random forums around the internet. I've found that a lot of the older DMs, who have been DMing since 2e or before, tend to play the game in a more antagonistic way with their players. And there are plenty of players that learnt this style of DMing from their old DMs. On reddit, people like that tend to get shut down quickly, because of posts like this. But in the smaller communities, like minded DMs get together and reinforce bad habits. Which sucks, because most dnd players don't know any better, so they assume this is how the game is played.   Example. When I was in undergrad, a group of friends and I were talking about DnD, and one of the guys absolutely hated it. I asked him why, and he said "it's a bunch of people playing with one set of rules, against one person who doesn't have any rules". I was so shocked that he just didn't understand the game, and I realised it must have been his DM playing against the party. Fastest way to drain the fun.
Traxxas 50k will be fine but maybe get some 10k as well, in some situations it's nice to have a thinner lube too.    What I do for spring noise is to remove the screw and put some heavy lube under the screw head. It's not that hard to get tensions right but if that really worries you just unscrew until the screw is poking out, counting how many turns you do with the screwdriver, and try to squeeze the lube under there, maybe with the help of a toothpick.
When you go through your friends, there is someone at the very end that says “it’s not clear how you get to know this character.” I am imaging that that is also a romantic option?

Why is no one painting the spawn in ANY of my games? Why is no one jumping to each other or calling out commands? Why is no one attempting to flank? This is embarrassing. I’ve played 10 games and lost 9 of them. My teams look promising to paint with buckets, rollers, etc over the opposing team and their splattershots and jrs. But we get DEMOLISHED. I’m talking the map is completely purple to our spawn with 70% or more the enemy teams’ ink.

I actually prefer Noire's new voice actress over Erin... Call that whatever you will, but I simply could hardly stand Erin's overly hammy voice acting at times (looking at you black heart...), so when I  first heard Erica's voice acting as Noire in 4GO, I was like: "Hey, not bad.". Then I heard Black Heart and... I finally buried the hatched with her... No longer will I ever cringe whenever Black Heart grandstands in serious situations :).

Brilliant game management this first half. We've done as much as anyone could do to contain Adama.  That said, Boro are clearly more than just Adama and Assombalonga looks very dangerous too.  Another massive 45 minutes coming up. We need to do exactly the same again and hopefully we'll get a second.
This game is like a fighting game. It is more niche due to the higher skill floor. It is unfortunate that playerbase is a form of validation for a lot of people.
Engineer may have formal meanings, but in essance it just means you are competent and trusted to make desicions.   The rest is just experience. Generally, either you get good at making desicions that noone else can (specialist) or you start managing other people making desicions  (management). Most people's career is a mix of both.
Only "beings of incredible power" can hold a stone.  So, the Guardians collectively, Ronan, Loki, Vision, Malekith, Doctor Strange, and yes, Thanos, can hold and wield Stones. Others I think could hold them include Cap, Thor, Spiderman, arguably Tony with the power source in his chest and his iron will, and the list really just goes on. The deal is just that a vanilla humanoid or someone with no power can't use Stones, because they lack the strength of body and will to survive it.
Ialways liked it, closest thing we had to Red Death which was my favorite D1 exotic.
I'm in the industry and I am not surprised at the price. Whenever glass is broken on a car, the paint almost always gets chipped and requires refinishing. Unless the shop you took it into is only glass and not an actual bodyshop. Additionally, a lot of the time the glass run channel and or door weatherstrips get damaged and require replacement as well. But I do not think that the shop is trying to scam ICBC. After over 10 years in this trade I would be absolutely amazed, because in my personal experience ICBC will complain about the smallest things on my estimates. They have come to my shop before because they thought my estimate was about 80$ too high. Just my two cents though.
Lol that’s amazing!
It seems the last majority disagree with this though. For a few it seems worth it. But the rest of us it makes the controller cost 20 bucks more due to needing to buy some sort of extra.   A lot of us take the minor problem of dying while playing it which if you charge it shouldn't happen too much. For the major advantage of out of the box rechargeable controller. Personally I buy like 4 aa a year for remotes or something so i never would use them for my xbox. and it's pretty expensive to use them instead of getting rechargables.   At this point 360 and one included it seems like a reason to charge us more money. Cheaper to make the controller and sometimes they make money on the play and charge if you don't get a 3rd party
My parents remember the big lines for Milk in the 1990’s Russia.... fuck socialism.  They lived through the fucked up socialism in Russia - piss poor products, tiny salaries, awful medical and dental care (no anesthetic etc, awful treatments).  When I was born with weak lungs- there was exactly one breathing apparatus in St Petersburg... with the grace of God - I got on to the waitlist for that and survived.  I know what socialism is and what will become of this great country if the leftists take over.  The day Trump won, there were dog therapy rooms for students to “cope”. Irony is, most of the school is Chinese international students, they didn’t give a shit either way - but still looked sad, just because they got scared to death with all the leftist propaganda.  This is America, we should be free to express any political affiliation!   Go TRUMP!

To add to this, marking, healing and reviving are the easiest for most people so don’t use these challenges early and save them for the 100% population challenges in the ending weeks.
How exactly is reflecting a bad idea? You get out of all pressure for free and don't have to hold any of the pressure. You can superdash though and get your opponent before startup on their moves and clip them for a full combo. Of course, it could be a bait and you could get 2H'd, but you could also reflect and avoid all of that.   Not bad ideas.   You mention staggering. At any point your opponent could score a counter hit. Not a ton was changed, but there are noticeable changes. Like someone else mentioned, you don't sound like you know what you're talking about.
I don’t see the joke but okay.

Whoo-ee a lot I gotta reply to, first off thanks for the feedback, when and if you make any changes for your playtest I would be more than happy to hear what they were and how they may play out. I'll definitely use that info for revisions.  1. Flavourwise yeah I could do that, I wanted to keep it as close to existing abilities as possible to avoid confusion, nothing stops you from reflavouring your abilities as a player anyway.  2. I don't think it actually has to, if going by 5e syntax. Following the barbarian's capstone ability, the change of the maximum comes after the text for adding 4 to the ability score itself. As far as I can see from official text as examples, if there's a change to ability scores that is limited by the maximum, *that's* when it needs to be stated in rules text.  3. Suggested fix for lingering drugs? Intent: The feature allows a modified painkiller, referred to from now as a lingering drug, to have it's temporary hit points persist beyond it's normal duration. Using it again while a creature is benefiting from lingering drugs causes the oldest beneficiary to lose their temporary hit points granted by it. At 7th level you can have it active on two people. How would you word the above mechanical text?  4. Would increasing the reagent point cost for this feature alleviate any issues? To make it bonus action AND numbing tincture would consume 4 reagent points, almost a third of your pool.  5. Okay, I see what your proposed fix for numbing would be. Interesting. I could do this yeah. I'll make some changes and see how it looks to me.  6. You feel that knocking prone is too powerful? I could boost reagent point cost if necessary. As written allies wouldn't be affected by it for two reasons, first they need to be damaged by the bomb, second the text uses(that I now noticed) poor wording of 'enemies'.  7. Shaped charges still applies, allies automatically succeed saving throws. I could lock the restrained behind a second dexterity save, but bear in mind that for sticky concoction to work, the enemies must have failed the initial saving throw against the bomb. It seems thematically un-intuitive to force to saving throws. As for reagent point cost change in pairing with the aforementioned nerf I agree.  8. The problem we faced in playtesting was players "stacking" a few dozen bombs on a single area and then throwing an enemy into it before detonating. Some limitation for how many can be placed should probably be implemented, Suggestions?  9. Barring the sticky concoction nerf you mentioned above, any further suggestions for balance changes? My thought is swap smoke and concussive and increase the point cost of concussive.  10. Originally it applied the frightened condition, but again it seemed narratively unintuitive since they're not frightened of you, but the visions. Right now it's just incapacitated.  11. Suggested fixes? I wanted to keep it mechanically distinct from the monk's one punch man. Single turn of stun?  12. Suggested nerfs? Not sure I see a good one barring cutting Virulent and replacing it with a different ability.  Overall, Suggestions for redesign to bring the main class back into the fore-front? I don't really think it's needed but I'd love to hear how you would have designed it. Let me know how your revision plays out and what worked and what didn't. Thanks for the review.
Is your mom every redditor
This last month with finals has been tough!!! I ate waaayy more than I had planned to, but I also learned a lot. For example, I ate more than I should have, but I couldn’t eat nearly as much as I did before starting this journey about two months ago. I gained some of the weight I had lost (about 3 pounds), which put me behind schedule but since then, I’ve managed to re-lose it. I’m down 11 total lbs since starting and while it seems slowly, I know my body is still adjusting.   Finals are over now so the stress level should get better. It’s summer and I have slightly more time in the day (no longer having to study 24/7) which means I should be able to exercise outside. I’m very excited.   Making slow progress on my 30 Day squat challenge, but every time I do it, I know that’s more squats than I was able to do the day before. And thinking about starting C25K again. I did it years ago and quit midway through.
When nearsighted, (in some cases) your eyes’ focusing point is closer, so whereas a person with 20/20 vision would need to hold something slightly farther from themselves to read, someone with nearsightedness can read it perfectly clearly when really close to their face, but blurred at the “normal” reading distance

The cooler isn't that valuable honestly. Just get CRYORIG H7 and SSD instead of H110i.  Get better cooler later. You want that SSD. OS is so much smoother with SSD.
Depends on playstyle. Keep one trinket that gives passive healing for deed runs that cause bleed and no heals. Then up to you, always keep curse resistance, reroll the highest hero power stuff until you get stats you want then play until you get reds.

Not true, a lot chars can at least do normal Proxima at T1, on my second account i started with Sharon, Ragna-Hulk and Ragna-Loki, they all had no problems, and later added Sandman and Ultron.   Sandman even at 55/6/3 or whatever could bring her down to 20% and then my Cap did the rest.    You can of course not do the daily bosses with them, but 5 x Proxima is better than nothing.

About the quality of auth YSL, I went to the boutique intending to buy the YSL shopper tote. She SA told me that it can't withstand heavy items and the straps are at risk of tearing. She has seen too many of the same bag come in for repairs. Damnnnn... you know you done screwed up when your own SAs talk about the bad quality of your bags.
Yeah exactly. LA really only takes over after Stockholm moves on. I’m not 100% as I don’t play it but I think Battlefield 1 is the same case as 4.   They just maintained stability and created the Test Server for BF4 (I’m not sure if BF1 has it) alongside creating a couple of the DLCs (which if they were Dragons Teeth and the one with Titan mode then I definitely agree that they were the best)
You can still set someone loose and be encouraging, the threat of firing doesn’t have to be constant. Could be every time a major deadline is due, quarterly, monthly. If there’s no fear of being fired then people can get complacent. If they know that there are 10 people willing to take their place, they’ll make sure to perform better than the rest. I’m not, and I don’t think anyone should be completely heartless though - loyalty and dedication do count for something. As long as the work expected is within a reasonable range, imo lighting a fire under someone’s ass makes them more productive. People who are self motivated would do fine, and it’s to weed out people who may naturally be lazy or get someone complacent to be productive.

So I was an apprentice joiner and was asked to go get 4 lengths of 2x2 from the yard. I get down there and i’ve not been on site long so I ask the labourer where they are he says “no problem wee man c’mon” we go over and the lengths are fuckin huge he starts pulling them out and asks me to catch the end, for reasons I do not know i decided to get the middle basically creating a huge see-saw with the wood. As soon as they were free because I was standing in the wrong place the recently free end dropped and he was standing directly inline to get a face full of 4 2x2 lengths... I just said “shit! Sorry” and he told me to fuck off with blood all over his face.
I think about this quote a lot and it inspires me to get shit done even if im hungover. Thanks Ricky

In my experience putting in effort into your messages rarely pays off. I still try to put effort into messages: try and relate to a hobby listed in her profile or ask about her trip abroad. Often time I get crickets back and when I do get a response it’s often a low effort response back. So the low effort thing is kind of ubiquitous

I put myself in a line of work that requires social interaction (dialect documentation). I stressed a lot about it, but I found out I could perform it OK. This was in part because I was mentally in "work mode" and so not concerned about being myself or acceptance. I had a pretty good idea of the social role I was supposed to perform, and at all times stayed conscious of it. (Goffman's *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*, aka "Field Guide to what Neurotypicals are Doing", helps a lot). I was even characterized as "amiable" in a local newspaper!  However, I was later reprimanded by my superiors, *very* severely (as in "I fear for your future here" severely), about my conversational behavior in informal afterwork meetings with other researchers. I don't have to say that this event more or less demolished me. So my only advice is, maintain your guard up at *all* times, even—especially—in "nonwork" situations. I also learned to avoid liquid courage; it makes the mask slip.
I totallyyy have had this too. I just keep longing for that emotion again. I did the best in college i ever have done and i was so on top of things. And the i felt my medicine stop working as well one day and it reminded me of what it was like with depression again. I went to my doctor and she raised my dosage to 60 mgs. Im still waiting to feel good again. She said that good feeling is your “therapeutic” dosage and thats what you want to feel better and after awhile you’ll get used to it again and feel normal again. So i totally know what you mean haha hope this helped
So what’s *really* going on here?
Woooooo. Drama. This should help me power through that 8 hour shift with no sleep. Keep it going guys.
I’d prob make extracurricular activities mandatory, I’m okay with fat people, I’m okay with losers, but one thing I simply can not stand is a fat loser. I’d ban hotdogs, I would create a test that determines whether or not a person is mentally stable to have a child and make this test mandatory for anyone looking to have children. Lastly, id make “computer literacy” into a class that has the same level of importance as math, history, science and literature.

I live in Australia. It’s hot for like 9 months of the year, and I still can’t stand cold showers. Starting off with a normal shower and then gradually working towards a colder one works well, but I could never do straight up cold water.
My husband’s parents love my children very much, but they have their own interests at heart before the children’s, and when the two conflict they prioritize their own. I suspect the OP’s parents here might have a similar conflict, since they talk about maximizing ‘their’ time and basically putting what they want first. My own mom flies in from ten hours away to see my kids but she doesn’t think that entitles her to a certain percentage of their time.

tl;dr = No.  Angular 5 (now 6) FTW.  Honestly, I'm a bit ignorant with React.  Once upon a time, there were issues with its license.  That might be resolved now.  Anyway...  And yes, JSF is like "Classic ASP with the code behind".  This is more commonly known as ASP.NET WebForms (as opposed to MVC which is different and very similar to Sprint MVC.  Look them up.)  Seriously, I'm into both Java and .NET development, and WebForms on .NET and JSF/JSP on Java can, for the most part, take a bow and exit stage left.  They have served their purpose.    JSF (don't forget GWT and ADF) and .NET WebForms, and any client-server-hybrid-component-oriented-UI-framework (dashes == complicated) like them were meant to solve one problem:  how to give programmers a consistent and productive UI API in their server-side language of choice.  In those cases case, the developer would be able to express the UI in Java or C#, and then the framework would take care of emitting the necessary HTML, CSS, Javascript, and server-side event handlers to allow your components to function.    In practice, this meant the framework would create a bunch of code that you would, in the event of gaps in understanding or outright issues, have to struggle to understand at runtime as they would emit code across all those tiers at once.  Oh, and they all had unique page lifecycles.  So, say you wanted to customize, or create a component?  Well, sometimes, you could get downright elegant with just the right code in just the right place.  It usually wasn't very elegant though, and the complexity meant that no amount of documentation could stand in for your personal pain and suffering.  You either had suffered enough to understand them and be able to twist them to your needs, or not.  Now, with Angular (and I don't mean v1 AngularJS because I love Typescript and v2+), you can do something more direct:  You can learn a new programming language which is easy if you understand Java or C# (i.e. Typescript - at least for Angular) and you can learn some new tools (e.g. Ng CLI and tslist), and then you can learn the Angular 5+ API related to components modules, etc.   And then you have your APIs.  And of course, APIs can be implemented in anything using REST or RPC patterns, just like before.    And you're done.  This knowledge applies across any back-end technology you might want to use.  Your UI skills don't automatically apply to just Java projects anymore.  Or just PHP.  Etc.  Your UI skills apply anywhere you can issue HTTP requests to APIs because your UI executes entirely (or almost entirely) in the browser.  This has its own issues, but it's a far simpler model.  In the meantime, the component oriented UI framework is the silent champion here; at least if you use Angular.  We, as an industry attempted to let everyone work with components in their language of choice.  Well, for the most part, that requirement imposed too many limitations and created complexity across all the tiers.  With some compromise, we can now still use a component oriented framework, just not necessarily with that "one true server side language".  In the end, it's very reasonable compromise.

>Another thing that bothered me is that the daydream wasn’t particularly  disturbing me until I snapped out of it and realized what I was doing. \(...\)   >   >Well what \*were\* you doing? You were brushing your teeth. Your mind was on autopilot, in a stream of consciousness.  So, why did you brain come up with \*that\* particular fantasy? The simplest answer is because it's fun. Violent fantasies are fun and exciting. It's a way to channel one's negative emotions, to let go of frustration, to feel alive, etc. You could come up with a lot of reasons why violence is fun, these are just some of the possible reasons.  Anyway, people love violence. It's all over pop culture, it's in the language people use \("I'd kill for a glass of water", "I'd strangle that guy, he's so annoying"\). But at the same time, they want to keep their distance from actual violence. However fun it might be to imagine violence, violence is also terrifying, dangerous, threatening. That's how a taboo is created.   In other words, there are two sides to violence \- the fun side and the forbidden side. Most people don't confuse the two. They enjoy violent entertainment, but they're terrified if they find themselves in the middle of a bank robbery. But in your case, you feel that tension between fun and taboo, and it makes you say things like this:  >I definitely don’t have the urge to do ANYTHING like this, and even if I  wanted to, I couldn’t, since I can’t even drive or own a car. \(...\)  You felt the need to say that because your fantasy felt very real. It wasn't just a fantasy \- it was "a disturbing chain of events" that made you doubt your true intentions.  Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I tried to explain why violent thoughts can be such an issue to \*some\* people \(I'm not gonna say the three\-letter\-acronym\), without giving you any kind of diagnosis.  Good luck with your appointment!

People like J. Peterson, Pinker, et al are not alt-right, just liberal individualist opportunists trying to sap any kind of mass movement on the left or right.

Some of these are entirely extreme and are not even close to feasible:   > We demand that the retirement age for all workers – men and women – be reduced to 55 years, with proper pensions to ensure a decent standard of living for the retired.  So you have a maximum working life of 40 (35 more likely...) years to try and pay for your 16 years pre-work (at best, more likely 21/22 due to free higher education) and your approx. 35-40 years post-work?   > We demand that the banks, finance houses and insurance companies are nationalised without compensation, allowing for rents and mortgages to be drastically reduced.  This simply cannot function as bank properties are not wholly owned in the UK but by other governments etc.   Re: Nationalisation. I believe you can make a very strong argument for 5 things to be nationalised but going further would be tough to argue. Those 5 things being:   1. Healthcare - A healthy populous is better able to contribute to society. Sickness should not change your ability to survive based on parental/past income  2. National Defence and law enforcement - Governments need to pay to protect its people.  3. Emergency services - Ambulance services, Fire Fighting etc. Having a private firefighting force is simply unacceptable   4. Education - The one true equaliser should be free at point of service  5. Infrastructure - Roads, water, electricity etc. This one becomes the largest point of contention, though: what does/doesn't count as infrastructure? I can imagine fair arguments being made for the internet, gas, electric, water and roads. Also, rail services are natural monopolies, so I can see a good argument there. But other things (such as banks etc.) I find harder to see a strong argument - happy to be swayed, though.

Been living at the 2995 building (arguably the better building, as the office and most of the on-site staff live here) for two years. Maybe I can provide some info. (tl;dr: relatively safe, just mind your own business and don't wander at night)  I haven't heard of bedbugs in this building since moving in, but I know the other one has had them. Last fall we had a couple of roaches (the unit next to us had them, and they spread to nearby units) but a specialist came in and took care of it. Haven't seen one since, though the people in the ground-zero unit left within the month, which probably helped. The only real bug problem we've had is ants, but by being very diligent in kitchen/bathroom cleanliness, it won't be a problem.  Gang violence exists, but unless you go looking for it, you'll most likely never encounter it. Most people in the area are just going about their business.   In the past, it wasn't police sirens we heard a lot of, but fire trucks. Last summer there was a string of grease fires at 2975, and another in our building the year before. I've been working midnight shifts for the last three months and I've maybe seen police cars twice while coming home.

China’s economy will surpass the United States by 2028 by most estimates. Here’s the thing only YOU care about being number one, no one else does. We don’t care if we’re second or third or fourth, we don’t place our worth on such things. Your entire identity as a nation is summed with “we’re number one!”.  We’re good here, standard of living is high, everyone has health care, people have lots of vacation time, one year maternity leave, we don’t have overflowing prisons, we don’t have mass shootings every week, our kids don’t have to go through metal detectors to go to school, our cities don’t have areas you wouldn’t dare visit at night, we don’t have religious nutjobs writing laws, our government isn’t bought and paid for by corporations, or at least not anywhere near the level you have. Life is good. I lived in the states. Chicken was cheap, Amazon had a better selection, and life was shittier pretty much across the board. So much division and hatred of these people or those people, so little compassion for others, everyone concerned with only themselves.   It’s a sad sad culture, it really is. You can have it, we’re good.

Welcome! Looking forward to your posts, you sound like a fun slut already 😉
I highly recommend the Josh Rosebrook Cleansing Oil. To give you an idea, I finished Tata Harper Cleansing Oil and wanted something lighter? I bought two:the Votary. Super Seed Cleansing Oil and the Josh Rosebrook Cleansing Oil.  Both of them are totally organic. I much prefer the Josh Rosebrook.  I mean. The Votary Super seed is also VERY GOOD but once I finish it I don’t plan on repurchasing it. I DO plan on repurchasing the Josh Rosebrook though.  It’s my HG Cleansing Oil and it didn’t start out that way.  It’s so DAMNED good.

Best player that will ever play for us.  Please enjoy.  Alpha Wolf. World class athlete.  Has every skill physical and mental. Tackles like a monster. Talks like Ali.  Hall of Fame lock at corner and safety.  Will finish career at safety.  The Unequivocal best on multiple levels.  Completely underrated still.  Most important of all wants to win championships.  A true 23.  Jordan-esque.  The best to ever play.  All Galaxy.
Sorry for the late response but Mario just caters way more to a broader public than Link/Zelda. Zelda games are often complicated and with mature themes, and I don't think there are that many kids that play Zelda games. Mario games are the types of games that everyone can play, they're colorful, easy to play, and have recognizable characters.   Basically Mario is way more marketable to children, and most children aren't interested in Zelda games, so Nintendo could risk that they'd lose a huge chunk of their playerbase if Zelda replaced Mario.
I’ve been saying stuff about this too. I hunk they should remove the current imposter and put in the first version of Dir Wacht am Rhein from before .6

How can a team with shox and kennyS lack firepower? That was never the issue with this last G2 team, it was the lack of proper leadership. They are getting that with ext, shoxie was some of his best form when he played with smithzz and we get to see that again too. All we need to wait to see is who the 5th is. Not gonna lie, I really hope its kio or a motivated scream. When shoxie and scream were both on g2 they were so fun to watch just popping heads.

Lol nice story mate. That is normal, Atleast we learn on every mistakes. Just continue exploring your self. Cause in the world of crypto, We must DYOR.
Here's my experience playing in a few different clans that would generally fall somewhere in the top-20 range of clans on the NA server.  These are all clans that are focused on competitive play, social clans will obviously be different.  **Benefits**:  * **Gold Income** - Clans get gold in the treasury and dispense it to their members.  All the clans I've been in have paid based on (1) attendance/participation in clan wars, and (2) grinding out new tier 10 tanks.  Each clan decides for itself how gold gets divided, some pay more for officers or callers, some pay more for other things.  This is a good thing to ask about when joining a clan.  I'm usually active a few nights per week and will earn between 500-2000 gold per month from clan payments, depending on how active I am.  The more your clan wins, the more the players receive so top 5 clans would get more than that and more active players will as well.  Clans will also sometimes run fun events for their members like putting a bounty on killing an officer in a pub match, or platoon replay challenges where whoever submits a replay with the highest total xp for a platoon gets a larger gold prize. * **Clan Reserves** - Clans can earn credit/xp/crew xp/free xp boosters that, when activated, apply to the whole clan.   * **Wargames** - When WG is running wargames you can earn gold for participating in them * **CW Rewards** - You can get tier 10 reward tanks, unique camo, medals, etc. from campaigns and clan wars seasons. * **Getting Better** - You learn a lot from playing together and it makes you a better player. * **Fun** - Platooning with clan mates, CW, advances, etc... it's more fun than playing pub matches alone.  **Time Commitment and Other Requirements**:  * **Time Commitment** - Most (but not all) competitive clans will have an attendance requirement.  For most clans I've been in it's 3-4 evenings per week. * **Primetime Expectations** - If you're logged in to the game and a clan wars battle pops there's usually an expectation that you'll stop playing pub matches or platooning with friends and join the battle.  If you're online when there's clan stuff going on, it's not usually an option to do your own thing. * **Campaign Time Commitment** - Many people join clans because they want the tier 10 rewards tanks.  This takes a significant time commitment to achieve.  The exact rules for getting one vary from campaign to campaign, but in general you should expect to play 3+ hours per night during a campaign. * **Tier 10 Grinding** - Most clans expect their players to grind out new tanks for CW. * **Skill Requirements** - While most clans have a certain baseline skill level to get in, *some* clans will also have an expectation that you'll improve once you join by some metric (WN8, average tier, average damage, win rate, 3 marked tanks, etc.)
Yes I am, and I'm loving how welcoming everyone is here 👌🏿
Lmao. Dont complicate your opinion
Yeah I had a similar issue with my 10. The battery would be at like 40-50 percent in two hours of fair use. Same use on my Note 8 is maybe 80. It's just baffling that the manufacturer would treat customers so poorly. That's such bad business. You'd think a company in HTCs position would bend over backwards to fix phones to keep their customers happy.

Personally, even though I'm part of the minority, I don't 100% support the idea of putting in the latest patch with Brigitte and Hanzo.  Chances are, most of the OWL players probably didn't have sufficient time to adapt to the new changes and hero. As well, Brigitte in her current state is still arguably considered overpowered.  I honestly don't want to see another Stage 1 where Mercy had a 90%+ pick rate because she was too powerful, happen again because of Brigitte.  As for the change from Hanzo's Scatter to Storm, sure, we will see more Hanzo being played because he's significantly more viable now, but from what I've seen amongst players and streamers and GM+ friends, he's a bit too strong at the moment and is pretty much a must-pick as well (unless the team just doesn't have a Hanzo player).  I conferred with my Hanzo T100 friend (peaked #2 on Overbuff two seasons back just under wraxu, though he hasn't played much since then) about his opinion on the Hanzo changes, and I quote, "Hanzo is so much stronger and broken now and I love it, but don't tell Blizzard that". You can take that with a grain of salt, but the point is that the Hanzo change might break the meta on the pro OWL level with each team competing to see who has the better Hanzo (or Brigitte).  You may disagree with my opinion, but if you'd just take a moment to think about it realistically, you may agree to some degree that if the next Stage were to incorporate these changes, we'll likely see stale, repetitive gameplay again.  Anyway, that's just my two cents. We'll just have to leave Blizzard to decide what they want to do, so they're the ones calling the shots.

It is interesting that there is no explaining what is geocacheing exactly, it is just stated there. Are other countries more aware of this than mine? If somebody asks me what I'm doing, I say it is a tourist game of hide'n'seek.

More than meets the eye is good, but it is not a result of a rule change.

Tom Brady has it regularly and he’s been very healthy so there’s something to it, obviously. Hasn’t helped him catch a pass though.
> The same banal question that conservatives have been asked since the 60s, usually to infantilize their position  My point was that you were treating the articles arguments in much the same way...   As for my own personal opinions on these issues:  I am a fan of using bureaucratic government systems where they function better than the alternatives.  Markets are great at optimizing certain complex systems, but there are areas where they reliably produce outcomes that I think we as a society should see as failures.    > Eh, I think this is an unconvincing and hijackable point because it's quite easy to argue that the quality of these large scale systems are primarily dependent on the individuals that make it, and the freedoms these individuals have.  That seems to conveniently leave out the resources at their disposal: the societal stability, educational opportunities, infrastructures (physical, economic, etc.), grant opportunities, etc. provided by the society they live in. The tech industry is a good example of this.  Modern computing and all the goods that come with it only exists because of US government funding (mostly in the form of military research).  There's not a single piece of technology in the modern smartphone, for example, that wasn't developed heavily by US government grants before becoming sufficiently economically viable for companies to pick up from there.  Markets are good at turning existing technologies into useful products, but they're pretty inefficient at producing new tech.  Again, there are things markets do well, and things they don't.  Bottom line is, there's a reason the next major tech boom won't be coming from Somalia...  I also don't really subscribe to the libertarian notion of freedoms and liberty.  While I'm not really a socialist, one point I think socialist philosophy makes very well is that you can't separate economics from personal autonomy when talking about liberty.  It's possible to have all the personal autonomy that libertarians call liberty and yet be sufficiently destitute as to not be able to sustain your own life, let alone control it.  A definition of liberty that can call a man starving to death free strikes me as a fairly impoverished (or incomplete and pedantic) view of liberty.  Personal autonomy, of course, also matters, it's just not the whole picture.  Since we require food/shelter/extrnal-resources to live, no amount of personal autonomy on its own allows someone to contribute to society or make themselves happy.  A man living in the woods by himself may have complete liberty and no restriction on his rights, but the moment he finds himself in contact with other people his rights and their rights will interact in ways that are ultimately limiting to everyone.  For most people, the best things in life come from interacting with, living with, and working with other people.  But that inherently comes at some cost in terms of liberty. What matters to me, and what I think we should be maximizing is the well being and happiness of people within our society.  Libertarian philosophy treats personal liberty as a stand-in for well-being, which is a mistake.  Sometimes it results in policies that work, but in general it fails to optimize for what really matters.

I feel lousy. The Babymetal I've been following since 2012 is gone. For good? I don't know. We apparently aren't allowed to know. The management has treated us fans with total contempt. Koba has always been cold toward the fans, but this has gone beyond mere disdain. I have never, in 40 years of following rock bands, been treated with such disrespect by the people in charge. It appears that we are nothing to them but sheep to be sheared.  If there is a new album, I'll buy it. If I can go to a concert, I'll go. I can still enjoy Babymetal. The performers on stage pour their hearts out for us. I have the greatest respect for them. It's just a terrible shame that the stuffed suits who control the band don't care about anything except filling their pockets with our money.

He probably won’t stop using Sheik for Falcon. It’s a good matchup for her and despite not having the best record against the top Falcons recently he’s still the second best Sheik against them.

That seems like an awful long time to draw out the protagonists’ suffering. 😩 I think it would depend greatly on their endgame for the show... will they explore more than one generation for this setting? I’ve been curious since Season 2 started how they will deal with the book’s epilogue- according to the book’s epilogue [spoiler] (/s “Offred’s recordings were from the early Gilead period which seemed to imply that at least a few generations passed before the Sons of Jacob were overthrown. If the  show holds true to this part of the book we may never see an even slightly hopeful resolution for any of these characters.”) 🙁

It would probably be simpler to have  the effect just be acid damage, but treats oozes as if they had weakness to these attacks.   This would allow creatures such as water genasi and black dragons to still be resistant (since their resistant could be accorded to some sort of buffering effect or non-polarity) while dealing double damage to oozes (whose resistance to acid would be from being a stronger acid).
Winter Soldier's not farmable at the moment but deserves a mention because he's a solid blaster in addition to being a villain, so you're covering two bases with the gold and time you'd put into him.

If they aren’t perforated, like hoarding tarps, they need additional securement to the building, and are sealed so the wind can’t get inside and grab it.

I am as well. To be honest I have never liked the way they are portrayed. I still think if they Matured the characters and made them more dynamic like trunks trying to become the strongest and succeed where his father had failed so many times. Added with being the Prince considering Vegeta is king...planet or no planet. Then you get Goten struggling to live up to his fathers legacy as well not only would that seem impossible but if you made Trunks the strongest of the two it would really make for some dramatic character development. I wouldn’t want kid Trunks and Goten. The format of shorter seasons would really be great as well. No more filler and you could just have really fleshed out story lines. Use the manga in the traditional way but also have other mangas that could dive deeper into certain plots and culminate into stand alone movies. You could have a manga series for Jiren’s universe and base it in the same time line and then have a tie in movie that was also cannon and featured both universes.  Then boom slide right into another season of an animated series that pics up where the movie ends.
Ahh there it is.  Yes, the policies that physicians have zero control over and contribute nothing to.

Let’s be honest. You came here looking for everyone to say you had a great resume and when that didn’t happen you resorted to saying things like “just because many people suggest you do something doesn’t mean you should do it”. Many people spent their time reviewing your resume and giving great advice and your most frequent response at this point has been that resumes are subjective.

Yea i absolutely love the game and im terribly hyped with this map (i also play it anyways landing away from the plane because atm its currently unplayable, i have enough playing competitive at 20 fps on rotations) but they are not doing things right.   About h1z1, ye, but look how the game performs right now after the game is dead. Its so funny, they started to go down and they started to optimize the game.
You should take a look at McGowan's **'Psychoanalytic Film Theory and The Rules of the Game'**. It carefully looks at the (mis)application of Lacan in film theory. So this is a self-critique of Lacanian film theory.   The first wave of Lacanian influenced film theory was so-called Screen Theory that, as McGowan lays out, was a misconstrual of Lacan. The dominant voice was Mulvey's essay, **'Visual Pleasure and  Narrative Cinema'**. Her misreading has continued its influence in feminist literature with the notion of the 'male gaze'.   In the second way, the (mis)application of 'suture' becomes the dominant theme. See Dayan's **“The  Tutor-Code  of  Classical  Cinema”** as the dominant example of this misreading.  It was not until 1986 with Jacqueline Rose’s **'Sexuality in the Field of Vision'** does a Lacanian film theory emerge that Lacan would have recognised as his own.   With Copjec's **“The Orthopsychic Subject”**, Lacanian film theory takes seriously the notion of the Real, much to the shock of the first and second wave theorists that were still hanging about.

:( I'm out of ideas. Sorry I couldn't help you. Just last few things I would like to ask. What gaaps are you using? I always go for mindthegaaps. And remember to get the amr64 version. Also be sure to flash ROM and gaaps and nothing else before to first reboot. I really can't think of anything else atm. I would maybe try and format everything in twrp one more time and flash lineage. I know ppl did that and it started working but I suspect you tried it already more than one time. I personally never had problems with flashing anything. If I do los + gaaps and reboot, it always works.

That was in the prelude that explained why he wrote the book, and yeah, it's not a scientific statement.  But the basic point was to argue against the idea that societal changes are driven by changes in intelligence, or that modern people are neccessarily more intelligent than people earlier in history. (and pointed out that hunter-gathering arguably requires more direct applications of intelligence than farming)

I'm a fan of SHIELD, but I watch the movies out of duty. The ones I watched, I didn't like. Probably because I'm too spoiled with AoS stellar character develoment.

As a vechain holder, I don't agree with this. Vechain may have existed for three years but the public blockchain that we have all bought into has never publicly existed.

It was a paper for history class, and I ended up witnessing actual history. I find it interesting that there probably aren’t many people our age that saw it live like we did, right?  I turned the TV on just after the first place hit, and remember ranting to my mom about what an “idiot” the pilot must be for crashing into such a huge building on a clear day. They thought it was a tiny private plane. Then the second hit and my mom was just screaming and screaming, and the reporters took a few seconds to realize what happened. When the Pentagon got hit just a few minutes later, we were really panicking and thought the whole country was under attack. They showed the jumpers a lot during the live broadcast. Horrifying. After the actual day, they didn’t really show that anymore.
Yeah I was hooked every week, only time I lost interest were the Palm episodes but there were only 2 or 3 of them and we got some cute Killua action.
Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea and Anne of the Island.  Funny thing is for very long the polish translation of the title of Anne of the Green Gables was Anne of the Green Hills because, Gables translates really awkwardly.  If you google the books you'll find there are like 6 books with 3 spin offs about her children and other people off the village.
Tacos - just add tortillas and toppings.  Or get a hoagie roll and add some cheese and giardiniera. Throw it on a flatbread with some cheese and bake it. Generally anything involving putting it on bread then eating it.
Wow it’s so crazy you mention the serenity prayer because it’s something I’ve been heavily learning on (religious associations aside). It totally makes sense. I hope the sun begins to shine once more in my life. But you’re totally right, the only way that’ll happen is if I enable it to. I wish I could escape the bad times though.
You shouldnt give RNG these dive-comps. Its just default for them
Hi all,  I was gifted a pack of Kodak Ektachrome 50 Tungsen that expired in 1983.  I read that I should lower the exposure by one stop for each decade.  Is there a way for me to shoot this film with my Nikon L35AF even though it only goes down to 50 speed?  Thanks!
Hmmm. I’m not sure :/
Just asking, smaller than chinnasamy stadium?
But that’s not what I did...
Obviously I'm in the minority but I kind of liked Movie 43. It's definitely weird but the one about the parents homeschooling their kid was funny. Also the hugh jackman one with balls on his chin
> All pistols besides revolvers are classified as semi-automatic you autist  You aren't telling me anything I don't already know.  It's not just how they are "classified" it's how they behave.  And that's exactly why I'm advocating limiting all handguns to revolvers only in other posts on this very same thread, moron.
Which is funny because in my experience meat eaters are usually the ones that make it a huge deal when we learn someone is vegan/vegetarian. The only reason I’ve seen some people talk about being vegan is because other people will start a whole interrogation when they notice they don’t eat meat.
Ah that makes more sense. Thanks for your help! It’s South Yorkshire
Yea that’s my thought process. We both deal wth each other, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way.
Your co-worker's brother should question why the hosptial is even confirming to his non-wife that he is in the hospital. She is no longer his wife and therefore has no say so in any of his medical affairs and his medical attention is privileged.  Frankly, your co-worker shouldn't be blabbing his business to everyone.
Lol and no matter what happens, the rampant Sansa hate doesn't seem to stop. She wasn't on set, it was a problem. Now she is on set and it's still a problem.   People are making up and believing their own version of reality or just straight up denying reality all together just cause she showed up to work on a show she's been on since she was 13.   I don't think it's healthy to hate a character *that* much.   And for some on this sub it feels like it's personal against Sophie too. It's kind of disturbing sometimes tbh.
When will we have an actual martial arts combat scene? Metal fight was a joke. Fight choreography has been so underwhelming in Boruto. Fight strategy is gone too, replaced with one or two gimmicks, if they even bother with that. For example, Shikadai just straight up catches everyone with his paralysis jutsu, when it's been established you need to have strategy to utilize it well.
Lol.. Yeletew
No way Diaby is 32! 😳
We’ll know by Tuesday.
So there's much less physically strong units than I'm used to. I've never really used Tana or Syrene and just go with Cormag usually. Also seems I'll learn how to use a dancer right. Boots are definitely going to Amelia.

2.5 chapters covered, half of 79 and 80-81 exact. In fact, the next episode should cover at least 82-83, and probably a bit of 84.
Pretty amazing we're providing almost a third of the squad!  Not sure what Earle has done to deserve his place though and somewhat surprised at Earls inclusion- he's looked promising this season and is clearly a talent but it feels a bit early for him. Faz has been given a bit of a poisoned chalice here for his first tour as captain but he's definitely the best man for the job in the squad. If they play him at 10 then for the love of God I hope Eddie puts another playmaker in the backline.   From a Sarries perspective I hope we don't see the Lions especially for the first 3-4 weeks of the season. I've defended the amount they've played for us this season quite a bit but I'll be disappointed if they aren't rested properly in a World Cup season.
This is the answer to “what if rocks are actually soft & only feel hard because they tense up when we touch them” conundrum.
For those rocking a non elemental build who are long term players, remember you may have beast cestus which has beastkiller ( I think there may have also been a second stronger set of fists from that event also with beast killer that I wasn’t strong enough to get at the time)
Wait.. I was so sure I answered this question already... I think my internet crashed while saving it or something. Anyway yes I mainly played Xerath mid on my smurf because I used to be really good at Lux a while ago and a friend suggested me to try him out as well because he was "similiar" to Lux and there was this Xerath supp trend but I was too scared to play him on my main, especially because the Leona meta was running strong and a good Leona would just run me down. I think playing support in lower elo is really hard and I really admire people who choose to climb their way up by playing support in soloQ. While, yes, in higher elo support is by far the most impactful role I understand that for a lot of reasons lower elo players don't fully grasp the potential your champion has, maybe for a lack of experience or whatsoever. I played midlane and ADC all the way up to D2 before switching to support for the first time so whenever someone decided to play support to climb I feel like they're brave and have a lot of dedication to the role, even if it's not the best to carry in lower elo in my opinion.
i didnt resist because i was afraid hes hurt me eventhough he wasnt pointing a weapon at me is like saying im going to arrest you because if i have a feeling i dont you will commit a crime. do you see how unfair that is?

I would be angry and hurt. I’d want to know the extent of the cheating and rather it was an ongoing thing or a one time thing. I’d want to know if it was a relationship beyond sex.  Then we’d have a lot to work on. I’d want to save our marriage but I would need him fully committed to rebuilding trust. We’d need counseling. And we may or may not make it.

How do you start your writing process?  It seems I'm a creature of habit in that I create a notepad and just skim related papers, copying and pasting quotes and where they're from in a sort of messy collage.   I can only actually open up a word document after I've completed the ritual.  Also, shot in the dark, anyone ever look into public-to-private cost-shifting for either health care or other industries?
True that. I'm not Chinese or American, but have had the chance to live in both places.  I mean, in the 6 years I lived in Shanghai I never witnessed (or heard from friends) any sort of discrimination for faith.. Even historically, in WWII when the Japanese tried to kill many of the Jews in Shanghai, the chinese defended them.   They do distance themselves from the Muslim Uyghurs from Xinjiang  (or have treated them inferiorly during Hu Jintaos rule) But Xi Jin Pings policy seems to aim to change/improve this.   If you talk about education, aren't some US schools against evolution and secularist education?   And you do provide a compelling argument. One party rule is a tough pill to swallow, but they seem to be happy with it..  I've come to think each country with its culture, size, ethnicity has different forms of governing that work best for it! But that's just my two cents :p
What is HFIS?
Just thought of another one: 70s/CBS-era Strat headstocks (the larger ones). Hate 'em, won't buy a guitar that has one.
1. I wish other people understood how uncomfortable it makes me to be gendered in anyway (using she/her or he/him pronouns for example) and how gendered society is without most people noticing  2. That I would 'choose' to be this way for attention or to feel special - I am yet to reach a point in my life that I am happy with my identity and as such I often wish I wasn't this way, but that does not change the fact that I am this way and can only authentically live my life by being true to myself, which includes asking people to treat me differently to a boy or a girl  3. Sex is the letter the doctor writes on your birth certificate, to me gender is a label to which society connects a bunch of roles and expectations and by not being comfortable aligning myself to those that fit the labels of man or woman I am non-binary
>If I haven’t beat mom’s heart on any character but I don’t take the cutscene and go beat satan  You mean like, if you were to use the shovel and skip mom's heart?

Hi Jatt
So, collapse then.   Given the population, a collapse in India would result in Gigadeaths. Radical.
There are still old school D&D players who call their to-hit number “THAC0” - I’m sure people will use what they’re used to and everyone will figure it out soon enough. Similarly there are people who will always call “Talents” EPTs.
But it’s possible to make money off of ads on streaming services. They just don’t know how to/don’t care to do so.
Ohhhh shit.
I spent around $1500 on a surprise trip to a music festival he’s always wanted to go to. Other people give the guy a nice watch or something similar.   The point isn’t the money its the gesture. If you want to spend $20 on your wife’s ring go for it, as long as it’s still thoughtful and reflective of what she wants. Fake metal is obviously unacceptable but if she likes wood or something then fine.   Picking out some random ring that happened to be available in the pawn shop just because it’s cheap is not thoughtful or meaningful in any way. It’s not entitled to expect him to put in some thought and effort, whether that effort includes money is up to the couple. You’re getting really up in arms about the money comment and missing the bigger picture which is that the entire proposal was lacking and the ring was just a small (fake) part of that.
Thank you and I agree! It’s a great show to watch while I’m filing and painting my nails.
Ubers are cheap in Kiev.  I went to this museum last year and was able to get an English speaking tour guide for like US$10 or so.  He was great and took us to a few places that weren’t open to the public.
That whole conversation (which I haven't had btw, so maybe I'm loco) sounds like people liking an artist because that's the socially acceptable thing to do. Xbox vs PS4 etc
Honestly? I don’t miss him.  That’s not to say I didn’t like him at the time for the job he was qualified to do.  He also a heck of a back story that is hard not to admire.
didn't you say you write for a living? come on. hit me harder. i can take it.
I also am a teacher with a 3 year old and a 7 month old with a very physically affectionate husband.  It is tough sometimes!    You may want to consider how you can take a physical break from your children. For example, I will sometimes tell my 3 year old that I need a little break from the day, but later I will give her a little more one-on-one attention. Since I took that break, I come back more rejuvenated. It took a couple tries for her to understand, but now I think she gets that I feel frustrated and need breaks just like she does.   I am not sure what to suggest for your husband. I wish the answer was simply communication, but it sounds like you've tried that. Maybe try a whiteboard to write the answers to important questions (e.g. how much to feed baby) and let him figure out the rest while you watch a show in your bedroom with the door locked. However, make sure that you don't criticize the decisions he does make, especially if they really don't matter (e.g. what shirt to put on child).   I wish you luck!
I saw that but I didn’t see a Modi 2, which I mistakenly didn’t add the 2 to the title. Thank you for the suggestion tho!

Also my self given advice is to just full send it, If that’s what I should do.
So that is me in the clip. I don't have a technical answer unfortunately. But I have some input.  I agree with Em0nn overall. I think it's a result of the sprinting sideways motion, & combination with the direction mouse flick.    At the time, I was wondering if this was a fire arrow only effect. But having done a night, or two with the Hunter arrows, and supporting points mainly with snowballs; I've come to believe it is as stated above.   The effect is much more noticeable with snowballs, and fire arrows; like Em0nn noted, because of the heavy drops. But it exist on the Hunter arrows, and I found myself having to end my snaps earlier in the muscle memory action to hit some distance shots. I was conditioned with fire arrows, which curve more, so was ending the aim snap too far right. The curve also appears to go opposite of the twitch; this kinda happens with bowling balls as well. \(It also happens with melee parry repels in this game\) The effect is easiest to spot with snowballs in the lobby, thrown across the room.   Hope this helps in you unraveling the formula!

That’s what we’re here for.
From what I heard from Duncan, Leroux, Vecenie et al. the kid supposedly has the kind of innate basketball ability that you can’t teach. He certainly looks the part on highlight videos.   I know a lot of Boston fans on were convinced he would be a Celtic at this time last season.   A lot of us still have a soft spot for the guy and hope he comes through this. Whatever it is.
White people *are* too fragile for this world. I say this as a Whitey, while I am totally about science and evolution I have this total conspiracy part of my brain that firmly believes we're descended from aliens. We don't like this planet in its natural state. While a lot of indigenous races were totally happy living a primal existence, like in my own country the Aboriginal Australians lived for like 60-70000 years chillin naturally making huts out of tree bark and putting ochre on themselves and doing righteous stuff, and as soon as white people came here they were like no we need smooth surfaces and to not get dirt on us and to send other people to get dirt on them so we can get metal and do metal stuff, and everything has to be completely different to how it originally was. Existing without excessive technology and separation from touching dirt (camping) is a friggen hobby. And even that's too icky so we have to do it in constructions the size of a small cottage with electricity and stuff you know? 100% we come from a colonizing space species of aliens and there is no way we're meant to be here 😐
His mom wouldn’t appreciate it though.
she's barely funny in real life tbh. I watched her haters roast set online and it was basically the most 3edgy5me things she could say about everyone the entire time. Trixie can be funny, but to me I think she confuses "black comedy" with  "say the most offensive shit possible" way too often.
Bjergsen wasn't KDA player in his early competitive years, he evolved into that state tho.

That's my whole problem with it being added into regular matchmaking. You jump out of one lobby into another and get put into another Nuketown lobby that's maybe halfway finished.   My BO3 theatre consisted of Combine, Nuketown, Nuketown, Fringe, Nuketown, Combine, Nuketown, Redwood, Combine, Nuketown, Nuketown, Fringe, Nuketown, Evac, Exodus, Combine, Nuketown, Nuketown.  It starts to get annoying when people, who are mainly trying to boost their SPM and spawntrap, constantly choose this map.
Not really.  VoIP has existed for years and years, this isn't a new concept. Ventrillo, Teamspeak, Mumble, Curse Voice, Discord etc etc  It might be an OCE thing but in the majority of solo q games I have someone is always putting in a Discord link to get everyone on comms chat. That's the same as Duos using League comms.  They ended up developing it to help out with lower end systems by not needing to run another program. Also for those who don't want to use something else, the convenience of voice chat is right there.  I personally don't use it since if we do anything outside of League we need something else anyway.
Just imagine how much better your feet would feel while walking around with all that wonderful footskin still intact. All those nerve endings gone and now you’ll never know just how orgasmic walking around on shag carpet can really feel.

Actual answer with not a hint of snark? Here, have an upvote.
Honestly, most DVDs and CDs i get, i take to Sam Goody and sell them to them.  They take what they want and then i check Decluttr.  Anything they buy around .30 and up i send to them.  Unless it is a CD, then i sell it on Amazon.  Everything else, it goes to a local yard sale day and i always have tons of stuff for it.  DVDs and CDs are my bread and butter anymore.
All sorts of health food stores. Even the big name stores have a focus on healthy eating... The restaurants provide more vegetarian options, and healthier options, and I have way more outdoor activities to choose from without having to stress out about driving 8 hours to get there (or battling heat/humidity/venomous animals).  I'm just not made for the South... I mean, I'm not into the far-leftist idealisms (I'd be considered liberal by conservatives, but most people just consider it balancing out both sides) because they tend to be just as bad as far right... But other than that, which I can easily ignore, I'm right at home.

Literally anything to do with eyes. I can’t wear contacts, and can’t stand putting in eye drops or anything. I can barely stand the puff of air at the optometrist to test your eye.
Alright look. While I agree with you there, that we don't have NO responsibilities, I need to tell you, that a bad support is the worst that can happen to a good ADC. I tried to explain this 1000 times already I always get downvoted, apparently I can't find the right words. So I'm going to make it a mission now to gather replay clips of supports that just forsaken the lane or just make it impossible to trade with the enemy cause they are not actively participating in the trades. Funnily enough it seems it's the supports that actually pick tanks that won't even front-line. A leona standing 200-300 units behind her adc, won't do shit against the enemy if they so decide to just run her ADC down. She needs to apply constant threat to the enemy. Walking up when they try to take a CS, walking into the enemy brush to apply e pressure. Else there is no reason to pick her. Then there are the heal/support supports. A Janna/Sona/Soraka/Lulu/Nami that's not actively auto-attacking during trades with the enemy will lose you the lane aswell. There is little you can do. In both cases you just fall into a state of "trying not to lose" and try to get as much CS as the enemy allows you. If you're now really unlucky that support suddenly thinks it's a good idea to all in into 3 minion waves... (This shit's happening from Plat V to Plat II)

Gonna add to this to stay away from electrical outlets and plugs in your house. Don’t assume that because you’re inside you’re safe. I almost got fried when reaching for a light switch because lightning hit the extension cord in my yard and it came searing up through it and came out of the light switch.  Most startling thing to me was that it didn’t hit any of the trees or the radio towers in the immediate vicinity. Nope, just went straight for the extension cord that was lying in the grass. Might’ve been coincidence and it just happened to be in the right place at the right time, but holy shit anyway.

I have similar problems.  I'm mostly a software dev than game dev, but I go through exactly what you're describing.  I have family and kids to juggle too, so it's easy for me to burn out when the inspiration/passion starts to lag.  I've found it helpful to write down tasks and features.  Whiteboard, notebook, OneNote, Trello...  Whatever works for you.  Break them up into chunks that can be completed in a few hours or so.  The act of checking something off as done and being able to see future tasks in an organized, do-able manner helps me stay motivated.
The Y version is beautiful! But..I'm not sure how I feel about the U version. Having a more simple photobook this time isn't a big deal, and I think the Y version is a good example of how simplicity can be beautiful.   But the U version..yeah, it looks like a magazine photoshoot, and a bland one at that. I wish it was a little similar to HYYH Pt 1 or YNWA'S concept pics, because those were relatively simple too (excluding the hot air balloon.) I just wish they had went for a little something more. Both this and the R version make me think of a puma photoshoot more than an album concept, and I can't help but feel disappointed. Luckily, I'm still in love with the O and Y versions!

Dao is a combination of the radical 辵chuo and 首 shou. 辵 Means to move, 首 means leader, so the Dao means the leader of movement.  The term 导 dao means to lead, it is not the same character.  Incredible lack of literacy expressed by this gentleman.  "A process as described is not the process as it exists;"  道可道非常道 道 The Dao, as in the origin or leader of movement. It doesn't mean system of learning and has never been interested that way in Chinese etymology or literary documents. That interpretation is the opinion of the gentleman you sited, but it isn't accurate. 可 Ke, can: OK I think we are in agreement there. 道 This time it is used as a verb. To be able to Dao, which is convenient because a historically common use of the word Dao is to speak.  This time Dao is a literary device and play on words. 非 Is not 道 A noun, same as the original meaning. People twist themselves into pretzels over this, but there is really only one correct interpretation which is the one above.  Basically you can't say the Dao.  "The terms used to describe it are not the things they describe."  Also wrong, 名 means name, not term or describe. I challenge the author to find any period etymological source which says that ming means either of the things he said.  "That which evades description is the wholeness of the system;"  无名天地之始 Is either 无，名天地之始 "Not existing is the name of the origin of heaven and earth," or 无名，天地之始 without name is the origin of heaven and earth. Again, his interpretations are not based on any classical understanding of the document. It is a kind of personal interpretation or belief, but I'm starting to sense that he doesn't speak or read Chinese, much like Watts.  "The act of description is merely a listing of its parts." 有名万物之母 Is either  有，名万物之母 "existing, it is called the mother of all beings.= Or 有名，万物之母 "its name is the mother of all beings," 物 can also be described as "things" in this context, either way, again his interpretation is way off.  "Without intentionality, you can experience the whole system;"  常无欲，以观其妙 无欲 Means without desire.  Desire and intention are different words with different meanings. 观 Observe 其 Its 妙 Subtle, very small, mystery, or miracle. Again he wants to use the word system. It seems funny to w that system simultaneously means both 道 and 妙。  Again, personal interpretations of the text are fine, but this is his interpretation not the original reading.  "With intentionality, you can comprehend its effects.," 有欲，以观其缴  With desire, observe its border. Different people have interpreted this differently. Wang Bi said it meant that if you always have desire you will only see the border of the Dao. Huang Yuanji thought the term jiao was a stand in for 窍  which means opening.  So the phrase would read "have desire to observe its opening." Which is a term used specifically for meditation purposes.    "These two approach the same reality in different ways,"  此两者同出而异名 此 Means "these" 两 two, 者 things 同 together 出 leave, exit, depart而 and 异 different 名 name. Basically"these two leave together but are differently named."  There are many people who like to abuse the original language of the Dao De Jing to make their points, but it is entirely a matter of their own opinion.  In the case that you think daoists who spent their entire lives researching and trying to understand the Dao De Jing is ancillary, my suggestion would be that so are the opinions of Watts and this other gentleman. The difference is that all of the original classical commentators on the Dao De Jing were fluent in classical Chinese and spent their entire lives studying Daoism in its native context. I have never been able to understand why certain western (especially American) commentators on these books seem to have thought themselves more able to correctly point out their meaning than the original people who wrote them. Also, as an end note, I would like to point out that the first chapter of the Dao De Jing did not appear until hundreds of years after it was initially published.  Neither of the two antique versions of the book contain that chapter, so it is a later addition which was afraid after Daoism was already formalized Into a school of thought.
yeah there is possilibity, we will see what happens, I am not saying no nor saying yes right now :\)

Well, if your patron were a deity, you would be a Cleric. The beginning of the celestial flavor text gives a series of possible Celestial patrons. Of course, if your DM is lenient, you could just say you are a Warlock to whatever deity you choose; Pelor, Eldath, Ohgma, it is entirely up to you and your DM
It appears to be a device jerry\-rigged to cut, but someone added a dildo for comedic effect. Sorry, not specialized.

>  They don't have problems with thermal runaway or dendrite growth or overdischarge or physical punctures like most traditional chemistries do  That's not quite true:  * They do go into thermal runaway (Oh boy, do they ever): it's just that they do so at a higher temperature than other Li-ion cells * They sure do experience dendrite growth: when charged below 0 degrees C * Like any Li-ion cell, they are damaged by over-discharge; it's just that their voltage is lower (compared to 3.6 V cells), and therefore the over-dscharge voltage is also lower * Physical punctures: all Li-ion cells, regardless of chemistry, are tested to be safe in case of pucture
Feathers make pretty much anything shave well and all the Proraso soaps are good. You're looking at nice shaves on a sensible budget there.
First off "4-5 good pours and maybe 10 minutes of the server's time," it's not like they're lining up 4 glasses and pouring it all out at once. They're constantly watching you to see if your glass needs to be refilled, so that depends on how long you're there for, it's a never-ending internal clock going on in their head when they're at other tables, the bar, or in the kitchen. Your friend is right about the 20%, barring there were no problems with the service. The question of "guilt tipping" is still 20%, because anyone serving that bottle has spent countless hours studying wine, and has likely spent their own money on wine education to put them in that caliber of an establishment. Also, if you're bringing your own wine you should tip more than 20% of the bill because that server is still going to make less money than if you were a table that ordered off the list.  It's a privilege to bring in your own wine, not a right.

oh dang I totally read that wrong my bad how embarssing
Buy some pure ammonia from ace hardware. No scent, no soap, no color. If you shake it there should be minimal bubbles. Set up the tank with substrate, low flow filter \(highly recommend a sponge filter as it is crazy efficient for creating bio bacterial and a great mechanical filter\) and some hardy plants like water sprite \(great plant for filtering out nitrates and can be left floating\). Buy an API freshwater test kit. add a few drops of ammonia till the test kit reads 1\-2 ppm ammonia and wait. If the ammonia levels clear add a few more drops to keep feeding them. In a days you should see nitr***i***te readings and a few weeks after that you should see*** ***nitrate readings. The*** ***nitrite eating bacterial take longer to grow than the ammonia eating ones. If you have an excess of 5 ppm*** ***nitrite do a water change to keep it around 2 ppm. Once you can clear all ammonia and*** ***nitrite within 24 hours your tank is ready for fish and you can do a 90&#37; water change.  **Pro tip:** You can buy an established sponge filter from your LFS to hasten your tank cycling as they already have good bacterial on it. \(most fish stores use sponge filters for their tanks and are willing to sell them to you\)  Also if you know your tank is at least semi cycled you can add seachem prime \(the declorinator\) to neutralize the toxicity of ammonia and nitrites for 24 hours. This is a good temporary solution to keep the fish happy if there is a little bit of ammonia/nitrites in the tank. This will keep your fish from stressing over the water change and give the bacterial extra time to eat the ammonia/nitrite.  Without the established sponge filter it took me 3\-4 weeks to cycle a tank. With the sponge filter method I added one betta in a 10 gallon within 3 days with very close supervision. Tested the water day and night and observed for stress signs. If there was any sign of ammonia or nitirite I would dose seachem prime and if it was above 1ppm I'd do a water change. I'm 2 weeks in now and my boy is happy and healthy with no ammonia or nitirites.
Private message me your email. I have a book for hesi that works great for the tests. I got 1220 on my psych using it
>some douchebags were throwing empty beer cups into the crowd and once right over liam's head.   Wow that's really fucked up. The band was probably a bit off because they didn't play for a month. As for lyrics\-change... It wasn't nice when Sara wished death to Liam, but you should keep music/fans and all this personal drama separated. But if you don't know the context \- this lyrics\-change is actually pretty cool.  ps did Liam add new songs to the setlist? And what did he say about Noel?  pps I'm glad that Ashcroft was on fire. Great buy, had a chance to go to his concert, but sadly \- nothing happened.

I’m struggling hard. Most of my physical symptoms are done. But the anxiety and guilt are driving me crazy.   What specifically are you struggling with (other than not having a drink)?
You're refusal is definitely used against you.  I just got a DUI in 2016 late December. It took me a year to defend myself in court.   Sidenote /r/legaladvice told me I was fucked, should be, or would be yet without a lawyer I got my DUI dismissed essentially by googling shit. So don't ever go there for actual legal advice.

idk for me if the assignment is old lady you should immediately read as fucking ancient, and if you go for botox old lady you need to go OTT with it and look like someone microwaved Amanda Lepore. i stand by what I said, I'm unimpressed and she looks basically the same as she always does, just with a gray wig.
I feel like I'm being stalked by BM and it's making me very anxious.  I recently changed my Facebook profile photo to one of SO and myself.  It was a cutesy couple photo and all of my friends liked it and said we looked great together, and so on.  BM is on Facebook.  I am not friends with her, and the only friend we have in common is SD15 who never uses Facebook (because apparently it's only for old people now, lol).  SD has certainly never posted anything about me or tagged me in anything.  All of my privacy settings are set to only my friends.  I realize profile pictures are visible to everyone, but as far as I understand how news feeds work anyway, there is no reason why anything I do should show up in BM's feed.  SO got an email from her with my profile picture attached, saying "This was all over my feed this morning.  Tell Arianllyn thanks a lot.  Nobody knew what was going on until she started posting stuff".  Now the overreaction and the fact that it's somehow my fault that she hadn't told her family that her ex-husband was dating someone are separate issues.  What bothers me about this is the "all over my feed" comment.  There is simply no way that me changing my profile picture could have shown up on her news feed so the only way that she could have seen it is if she was actively looking for my profile.  I really want to just delete my Facebook (and Instagram) because the idea of her finding out stuff about me and my relationship like this just creeps me right out.  Unfortunately I can't because I'm a member of an activity group that uses Facebook to plan and coordinate all of it's events.  I've had to settle for blocking her and hoping that she doesn't find a way around it, or flip out if/when she realizes I've blocked her.

One of the best microphones you can buy on a budget is the Snow Yeti. It ranges around $100US and has the most flexible recording options of any inexpensive microphone including stereo mode, omni mode, front and back mode, and uni mode. The pickup patterns are fully selectable and it's a studio condenser mic so it has a very flat response.   For half that you can get the Sno Ball mic but it only does omni/mono recording.    For any mic, record yourself in a place with good acoustics, IE not too dead like being in an anechoic chamber, but not too live like in the bathroom.   Mic closer to you = more instrument. Mic farther from you = more room ambience and reverb.   Play with the mic turned up loud enough that you get close to maximum volume, but NEVER go over. You can always use audacity "normalize" function to bring up quiet audio to 00db. But if you go over 0db you get bad distortion.

Hey! I realize that life is keeping you busy, but I thought I'd share my concerns about theme with you. Honestly, it's identity is very strong and unique in almost all aspects of game play and feel, so great job.   My concern is only that it can be built in a way that tends to undermine rougues. There are generous amounts of augments that can mimic the double proficiency of rogues and bards. Bards do not feel undermined since they are full casting skill monkeys and tend to excell in social scenarios. Rogues are weapon skill monkeys that tend to emphasize dexterity skills.   The infiltration subclass can already do stealth related things in very unique ways that rogues cannot. The augments allow them to be dexterity focused skill monkeys as well. I would feel fine with this if there there were no rogues in the party, but I would feel very guilty playing or allowing this if there were rogues involved, which rogues tend to be a popular and fun archetype to create in a group. Furthermore, you get an uncanny dodge and dexterity save augment.   The main thing that an infiltration augmented does not have that a rogue does is sneak attack, but trading sneak attack for survivability, half caster versatility, and battlestrikes feels too good for such a similar feel.   What are your thoughts?

I believe the 'fake' in Odin's vault was a legit gauntlet (mark 1?) with the same characteristics as the one Thanos wields. We know that Odin has knowledge of the infinity stones. He had them make it on Nidavellir during his crusades with Hela, while he still had ambitions of a conqueror, and then shelved it when he banished Hela. Nidavellir was attacked while Loki was impersonating Odin, was completely neglecting the nine realms, which according to Thor were in absolute  chaos.

I hear you. I used to have a T4i and I was getting pretty frustrated with its limitations. Buying L glass took a long time to save up and I had to buy one at a time (and I'm currently still not finished upgrading my lenses), but once I upgraded to an 80D there were huge improvements. Sometimes the best upgrades are to just get better lenses, or slightly better bodies. You don't need crazy expensive bodies to shoot stuff.

You have stability, manpower for armies, and wars you can declare on other nations. You can ally other nations, and call them to join your war.   Plus, most students will have no problem, so long as you dangle things like a 0.5% grade boost to whoever wins. Kids will pick that shit up fast, no doubt.

Why is Karen from SAO Gun Gale Online so sensitive about her height? The wiki has her listed at 183 cm, which translates to about 6 feet in height. While that’s tall for the average woman, especially a Japanese woman, is it that rare to see a person that tall or taller in Japan? I knew women who were over 6 feet irl and they seemed perfectly fine.   I was expecting her to be like 6’8 or something from her height complex.
If we got one over on Tottenham for the second time this season, that would be a beaut.

I cannot guarantee consistent reddit checking, but I would be happy to read through and comment on anything I see in my inbox!  I'm happy to get the anwer about all having the same priority; I still don't have a clear mental model about how resource free\-up works.  In\-story, what year \(approximately\) did humanity last have 7 billion members alive?  Let 'The End' be the point at which system simplification directly causes death of any humans still alive; in the story, The End would have come for the two surviving humans at a certain point, and the death of one made enough resources 'free' to delay the ultimate date\+time of The End by a few weeks.  Does a human death when humans still had 7 billion members delay the ultimate date\+time of The End by the same amount, or by much less?  \(Does the birth and then death of a human result in a negative amount of resources freed up, rather than 0?\)  \(...even if resource chewing\-through at a faster and faster rate, unless the death of a human later somehow gives a greater amount of resources than a human dying earlier...  or else, the chewing\-through rate *starting* really fast, then getting slower and slower...  but no, still doesn't work if the resource cap decrease\-per\-unit\-time is external...  unless it's percentage based, the more 'free' resources there are the faster it gets consumed, in which case...  yes, one way or another there has to be a way that 100 deaths \(through simultaneity or timing\) doesn't delay The End as much as 100 \* the delay from a single death, but specifically how...\)  \(7 billion \* 2/52 =..!\)
If I were to guess right now on weather, I'd say 2 hours of cloudy weather followed by 1 hour of rain at the end. What I'm really hoping for is a bonus 6k dust from already completed quests and hopefully another 6k from "Catch 3 Charmander" quests done during the event. If I do 50 stops and 20 of them reward 200 dust as the reward, I'll get 6k dust (200 x 20 x 1.5)  That leaves about 23k dust to come from weather boosts and 2nd/3rd stage, which I think isn't too far-fetched.

The weird thing to me about connecting homeschooling with abuse is that we *don’t* do it with kids under school age.   At that age, we assume that the parents have the best interests of the kids at heart and don’t insist that a social worker or someone checks in every so often to make sure the parents aren’t useless or evil.   Suddenly when they’re school aged, though, it’s a different story and parents need “accountability” to make sure they’re not falling down on the job of taking care of a six year old’s needs, when that same kid at four was presumed to have competent caring parents. Nobody responds to a story about a mom abusing or killing a toddler with the idea that all kids should be in daycare or that social workers should visit every house in the country every so often. :/
I don’t think a question can be truth per say. However it can be used to seek truth but I still don’t see the point in your question.
It's supposed to be 3 rounds at 4.3 seconds, then the normal longer reload, but that's still pretty good. I am expecting it'll get fixed eventually for all first-order ammo racks. Makes it a bit worse for longer fights, but good quick rounds for brawling or quickly killing a couple of tanks.

As my income is still well above average, so I pay more taxes than most people and pay also the maximum health/social insurance rates (which is a percentage of my income). So excuse me for being so “selfish” taking care of my daughter and doing 50% of the house work while still putting so much money into the public system that others benefit from free education, cheap health insurance and everything else my tax Euros are financing.   From what you stated, you seem to be American, right? Here in Germany, factory workers nowadays are skilled employees with regulated working conditions, good payment and lot of paid vacation. And with 35 hours per week, they only work 3 hours more than I do.

I honestly do not know.   The two symptoms you listed are way too common in almost any illness or disease structure.  Anxiety can be caused by anything as well, and sometimes has no cause at all. So being fatigued and weak could mean the fever is still lingering, or you’re having worse anxiety than usual, or something else entirely new is wrong.   I suggest a call to your doctor and a new blood panel.

If you haven't given Moon a shot yet. I'll say, not a bad sci-fi movie.  It's seems these days they are few and far between decent ones.  There's an onslaught of them, don't get me wrong, but I just feel like they're starting to become regurgitations of something already done.  Especially with all the remakes and reboots.  My personal opinion given the climate of sci-fi, since the resurgence of Black Mirror, and the ever present love/hate/fear base relationship with technology, I'm seeing more and more Black Mirroresque films and tv series out there.  Some well done with a unique vision that has them standing out from the barrel of rehashed and overused trope storylines and synopsis.  Keeping in mind Moon was a 2003 release, and even watching in the year 2018, with all the sci-fi films this indie was ahead of its time. Worth a watch IMO.

I love Poppy and I wish it was more common in the U.S. I do agree that there are some other connotations (my first thoughts are "Papi" and opium poppies), but different names come with those sometimes--I don't think they should be dealbreakers.

More info: I got this rug at an antique store because I LOVE the design but it had a slightly strange smell and the backing is like crusty, see through, threadbare net? The edging around it is solid still but.. is there a way to get the musty (maybe animal pee?) smell out of it? I’ve tried a carpet cleaner, vacuuming, rug doctor.. I am totally willing to do whatever it takes because it is so unique and beautiful. It appears to be in great shape other than the disintegrating backing and the smell. Any suggestions?

Oh geez that’s a lot of wax for a handful of gummies 😂  I use distillate syringes...well, I plan to later. I picked up two one gram darts for that project this weekend!  I went with the darts because the THC in distillate is already active, whereas it’s my understanding that other things such as wax shatter etc still require the decarb process prior to use. Just seemed easier to use than having to decarb unfamiliar (to me) substances.   So my only thought for you would be to be sure to decarb your wax if it hasn’t already been done. Then, it should work just like distillate would, I’m place of, in any recipe.   Let me find the one I was gonna use

No exercise except some walking to and from work and I work a very sedentary job. I was pretty strict the first two months and tracked my carbs and calories religiously using MFP. Now that I have an idea about what i can eat in a day I'm still losing a pound a week or so but not worrying about tracking everything.

Depends on who you ask. Some societies are structured around polygamy in marriage.  But if you refer more to having multiple partners at the same time or being in an open relationship it's mostly two things: how it by definition challenges the institution of crhistian or traditional marriage and that there are real health hazards with that particular lifestyle.

Yes, this is a guideline meant for newer runners who are increasing their mileage towards some sustainable target.   If someone is looking to up their mileage from 70 to 90 mpw, for example, they shouldn't go out and run 70-77-84-92-70. The higher mileage you get the longer it takes to increase, but by that point people generally understand how to add mileage and no longer need this rule.

It's not like all of a sudden the mindset that has brought PR into its current situation is going to change if he gets his way.   Because all you've just said here is: "Borikén know your place!" How is your current situation fixable through servility?

My boyfriend is out of town. He’s a very socially active person, so I’m looking forward to staying home and getting some cleaning done and maybe some hobbies. I can’t remember the last time I’ve hung out at home!
Right? Maybe it’s fresh water in the bags and they’re floating in salt water? Is that s thing? Is that how it works?
The brilliant 0-0 draw. I thought he was bought for such games but dropping deep and not keeping his discipline?
The high cycle sounds and looks nice but it’s a tad bit short. Is there any way to get a longer barrel on it?
けっして is much stronger - it means "absolutely [not]" or "never". 中々 is more like "[not] really".  your first answer means that the bus *never* arrived, whereas 中々 implies that the bus was just really late. the second question is more of an idiomatic issue IMO; your answer is like "i won't forget tanaka-san *at all*" whereas they were looking for "i will *never* forget tanaka-san".
There is a bit of irony that Corsi published "Killing the Deep State" then tries to besmirch Q and even Trump.  Even more absurd has been Corsi telling Trump what he needs to do.  Laughable on the face of it, but divisive and cult-like.  Then again, what has Jones/Infowars become from the early days?  Jones lives VERY well.  Nothing wrong with that but now he actively interferes with the movement forward.

Why do people downvote this? This is funny
I want a family. But I also don’t want the pressure of the biological clock freaking me out. It might cause us to make bad decisions. My aunt is 41 and she’s having her 3rd child with her new husband. I think there is still hope for us?

Question—how did you find out what your actual TDEE was? Just trial and error, or a better calculator?
8 is too much for a sophomore. That’s 50+ miles a week if you count in a long day. I would make at 6 and do 8-12 either Saturday or Sunday for my long day. That’s 6x5=30 plus 8-12 for long day which is 38-42 miles per week.  Also I would only do base for about a month and a half to 2 months. After that I’d run a standard 6 mike run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, do some kind of Fartlek, like a half mile, 2 minute or 1200 repeat type of speed workout on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then long day on Saturday. The speed runs should have a mile warmup and cool down, and 3-4 miles of speed workout.  The most important part of speed is finishing as strong or stronger than you start. Watch almost ANY world record race, and they pave themselves. The biggest flaw by far of high school running is going out to fast, fixing that problem starts in training. If you eat healthy and run 6 days a week you can get your time down pretty substantially.  Also after your bass is done, those standard 6 mile days on Monday Wednesday and Friday are RECOVERY runs. 7-8 minute pace is just fine. Those are the days that make a good racer.
Lol why are you being downvoted XD
Mercedes had no influence over the tyre decision, Ferrari would’ve complained already.
It seems like this week Tour 5 has been all replays or geared-up tournament preppers. Not enjoyable at all.
From small transportation renting services like Citibike, those scooter companies should work with the city to put those scooters next to bike sharing stations instead of allowing people to just leave them to the side. I'm surprised those companies make money as I can see all them just being stolen as its easier for people to carry them and leave them to the side.
Also if you cannot afford the bail their are what are called bail bondsman. Typically you pay them 10%  of your bail and when your ass shows up to court the bail bondsman gets the full amount back instead of you making 10% on top. If you dont show up they can and will come find you using very aggressive means. Bounty hunters ( the private police basically sent after you if you skip out on  a bail bondsman) have more leeway in a lot of areas than even the police when searching for someone.
Even a more recent example would be 2017 Jags. Not as good of an o line but man that defense and running game were good.
I must say rezakiri ain't what it used to be. I'm not surprised. Reza was  lot scarier before the first wipe. And if you have stagger boost and you're dodging right it's very well doable. And going for high damage can be a double edged sword as it will leave you with no stamina to even dodge if you do 2 jump primed strikes. So that's why I am not 100 sold that it's OP. It's veerrry good for sure
I like my Karn main board, but I only run 1. I prefer Hazoret in my sideboard over a second Karn.
Flickering definitely hasn't been dealt with. Lots of AOC and Samsung freesync monitors still have it.

When this whole macro discussion started I've used one for SKS too for 1 or 2 rounds and the advantage isn't that big. I can spam the SKS by clicking just as fast as I could with the macro, the only difference for me was (and that is just because I rarely spam fire semi auto guns) that its abit easier to control cause I don't have to do every click by mayself. But this is just a small advantage and also most likely achievable by practice without any macro.
I'm so sad for Surie, the guy that jumped her looks very mentally unwell from his twitter. But she's been hopping about Eurovision all week like an excited hummingbird having the best time, and it breaks my heart that what should of been her shining moment tonight was kinda tarnished. I'm so proud of her though.
I agree with comment about 173. I have no idea why 173 + 225 give out so many A’s as prerequisites to enter CS tracks. And I feel like the way the courses are taught don’t have student getting the most out of them. Take 173 A, you can ace examlets by looking at past exams and quizzes and homeworks by pulling facts out of the book. We have a lot of students, but written assignments like math 347 has are necessary. 225 could use this too. 225 completely handwaves the theory and proofs by only having labs and MPs as homework. 173 could also cover more 374 content (based on what the top 4 cover in theory early on) and 225 spends too much time on C++.
At least he’s not down there with a laptop. Book still expensive though.
This is so weird. The first time I’ve seen this and not been able to type “same for TL fans”. I think it finally occurred to me we don’t suck anymore!
Thank you very much. I am thankful I had favorable circumstances that allowed me to get this done. (single, no kids, boring job)  Also /r/WGU overall is the main reason for this. Without them I might have been lost.
As someone who ran back all the way through the game after I got each new ability to uncover something new I previously couldn't access before... I probably would have saved myself a good 5-10 hours if I just did story mode for a bit longer. I could be wrong, as there are probably some nice early upgrades if you backtrack early, but I would suggest progressing with the story a bit more.
Savitri Devi writes some interesting contnet on the Kali Yuga, the Kali Yuga is the last of the four stages.  The Decline of the West or The Downfall of the Occident, is a two-volume work by Oswald Spengler which I think is more coherent and academic.

Lmao FTL is ridiculous... I check my selected stores for Katrina’s it changes my zip but I still have the closest store has the closest one and the farthest one as the farthest  But then I close out of and go back and it changes my zip again and now makes the farthest store my closest and my closest store the farthest... close it out and check it again a couple times and it keeps switching between the two zip codes, neither the one I initially put in
I buy them with real cash cuz they look like bit-coins.
The argument isn't just about which weapon is better. It's about if the PRF is better, by how much is it better?  Is refined wind brand so much better over a bladetome that even remotely thinking about using a bladetome is ridiculous?  Compare that to someone like Karel where there is no reason to use any weapon other than his refine. Karel with his refine becomes pretty good. karel without his refine is almost unusable.  Soren with his refine is pretty good. Soren with a bladetome is also pretty good.  Measuring priority of a PRF refine is about combining both the raw increase in performance between the refine and the unit's other options, and the unit's actual performance with the refine.

So frustrated today. After hitting 125.4 (goal is 125) immediately after my 33 hr fast, I knew the scale would pop back up, but this morning it was all the way back up to 128.4. Whyyyy does my body love 128 so much. I could have handled seeing 127. That's a nice number, one I haven't seen much because 128 keeps butting its rude ass in the way.  And yeah, I totally get that I'm quibbling over a couple freaking pounds when I feel fantastic, feel like I look fantastic, and would actually be happy if I hit equilibrium right around this weight... but at this point it's hit my stubbornness factor and I want to consistently see 125 for at least a few days before going to maintenance!  I know the scale isn't everything, but my measurements haven't gone down in the last 5 lbs at all, I'm holding steady within a half inch of all of them. Just numbers. They're all just numbers and I shouldn't fixate on them. I feel good, I look good, I'm happy. Maybe I *should* just switch to maintenance for the rest of the summer (grumbles and side-eyes the scale).
Cock-a-doodle-doooo! Another no-moji one, it is anarchy here, anarchy! I shall moan to the mods until they ban me.   I am up and full of beans, went to bed at 1.

In your dorm there should be warehouse on the bottom right. In warehouse should have a tab for gifts if you have any. On the bottom of each gift it will say "GIFT." Just click on that and you should be able to give it to any T-dolls that are in your dorms (I believe the t-dolls are put in dorms according to the echelon they're in ie Echelon 1 = Dorm 1).

Another GMO opinion puff piece.  Intelligent people don’t worry about the genetically modified organism but rather the toxin designed to be sprayed on that GMO organsim.  I’d like to think that if the science was sound they wouldn’t need opinion puff pieces written and pro GMO ads on Reddit.  This “article”  is part of a marketing campaign.
Interesting! So you still did makeup and only used a cleanser to take it off at night? ... and thank you for the reply!!   I’ve recently had a TERRIBLE breakout (after having  a week or so of really good skin, too...) and I’ve been considering “taking a break” to refresh... but my skincare routine is honestly an addiction. I feel almost incomplete if I don’t go through with my routine, even if it’s possibly what’s making me breakout. I’m also nervous that it’ll only get worse if I stop using the products.... How can skincare be the best AND the worst at the same time?! UGH
Does a rabbit attack you when it's "spooked"? A cat? A ferret? A guinea pig? A rat? All these other pets tend to run and hide under the sofa when they're upset. Not little doggieflumps though.

I just switched back to Arch, after using Ubuntu based distros for a year. The reason is that lots of the software packages I was using on Linux Mint/elementaryOS were a little annoying to install. To get the latest versions of the software I wanted, I was downloading AppImages, deb files, and even some source code to compile stuff from scratch. Which also involved hunting for dependencies and installing lots of tiny packages. Arch has the latest version of everything I want, right in the default repos.
Yes it belongs here because it’s so cringey that.... they might as well write bloody books instead of paneling their faces and stuff. Jeez it’s like a story everytime
I’m 17 and first played this game when I was 7 and recognized it immediately
Probably will trade Baldin (2), Blodin (2), DKali (4), and Eschamali (3) but I’m not super happy about parting with any of them except maybe Baldin, and trading for the Next Big Thing will be even harder, so hopefully I can just roll him with the free roll and call it a day :P
Not arguing for one way or another, but to play devils advocate this is nothing new for Destiny. Missions in D1 (and expansions) were commonly ran again as Strikes. Sometimes they were ran backwards. There were lots of areas for missions in D1 that were also reused multiple times. D2 just followed the trend.   What’s cool about Warmind is just how much PvE content you get with the expansion. Aside from an overall solid campaign PS4 users get 3 Strikes (one exclusive and yes I know that’s shitty) while everyone else gets just the two final missions ran as Strikes. However everyone also gets Escalation Protocol which is actually a lot of fun. Plus there is the post-campaign missions for Sleeper Stimulant, exotic sword memory chase and Ana Bray missions. And while that might seem like a small thing it’s actually a big step up from every prior DLC release excluding The Taken King. Most DLCs just end and that’s it. CoO had the vex weapons but the grind was so extreme and time gated that most would just consider it a side objective. And then finally a new Raid Lair which people are really fond of.   I’ve been an avid Destiny fan since D1 and I’ve hated D2. With the release of Warmind I’m finally able to say that Destiny 2 feels like Destiny. With all the exotic and sandbox changes gunplay is actually fun and there’s a semblance of a loot chase in the game as we speak. While old locations still feel like D2 the new Mars areas and activities feel like OG Destiny and it’s great. While there are still big stinking problems with D2 it’s at least moving in the right direction. Once mods, armor/exotic armor, and better rewards comes online I think D2 will be close to surpassing its predecessor. Now all we can do is hope they don’t fuck it up.
It was the best place to put a wall, mountains and gorges help make up a good part of it, and it's the skinniest part of Westeros besides the neck. But there is still good land north of the wall, land that bold individuals wanting to be free of lords and kings (taxes), can settle.
It’d be interesting if, since the shadows are soft, there was a slope implemented based on the darkness gradient of the shadow.  Where it’s darkest could be a complete cutout and the transition to that area could be sloped almost as if the figure is melting into the shade.    That might be ridiculously difficult but may be a fun exercise to attempt nonetheless, and it may diminish the “puzzle” feeling a few people have mentioned.  Regardless, I’ve had cool shadows catch my eye a lot lately and I’m a big fan of your execution on this concept.  I might play with the idea a bit myself, though I’m a bit less practiced.
LMAO  I LIVE FOR GRAHAM <3
> Last I checked, I’m not going to be sent to these camps for criticizing the government or president.  That doesn't mean they aren't basically camps in which people are denied their freedom and basically have to work. And many of them are in jail for crimes that don't even harm others (like weed) or for crimes that are a result of poverty (which the US government doesn't care to address) and the drug war.  And you were the one that portrayed the US as not having "labor camps." I'd say we do, just under a different name and slightly different circumstances.

It should be fine. I left a couple of my succulents bare root for a week and a half once while I was waiting for new soil to be delivered. They got a bit wrinkly but perked up once they had some water. I'd imagine if this guy got overwatered you'd be able to leave it bare root for quite some time since it will have a lot of water stored up.
Who’s owCreed?
I started watching it but I didn't finish it because they lost me at some point.   It's really simple for me personally..it's all true...like I've personally heard about hauntings even from the most close-minded atheist so non-corporeal intelligence is not foreign to me, but at the same time, the earth just isn't flat so it's only the question of how many ancient traditions actually misidentified aliens or just the terrestrial crypto-zoology that we already have going on..   I think one of the Lakota tribes have differing accounts where some unnatural sources of light are of benign origin whereas other lightsources are bad omens
I’m an alcoholic you insensitive asshole haha
People desire their inferior(maturity induced) but due to it's weaker strength, aren't necessarily great at it. So an INTJ will be observant but miss many details and Ni fills the blanks. This is how they come to many outlandish assumptions when immature, but with growth, come to terms with having to actually experience things(observe) before forming a solid viewpoint.

I think this might be a union thing. If a company hires non-union employees, the rat patrol shows up. I was told that by a union tile man several years ago.
Because, they treat Jinder like he's terrible, but I honestly think he's a solid 3 star worker, and a 4\+ on the mic. People don't talk about him as in, "I respect him, he's good, but not my cup of tea..." They talk about Jinder like he's wrestling poison, and Meltzer will tank his ratings on him...
The tournament system needs some major updates:  Rewards need to be incorporated into the tournaments system. Tournament hosts should be able to insert a 1st place prize, 2nd place prize, and 3rd place prize.  Psyonix should sponsor daily tournaments for each region in 1's, 2's, and 3's. The winners of those tournaments would receive some reward in keys (15 keys for first, 10 for second, 5 for third).   The winners of the daily tournaments would ideally get their names listed somewhere in-game (cool idea, menu item like leaderboards).  Tournaments would be awesome if anyone could see tournaments in place and view the bracket and speciate in game, not just the tournament host. I believe dota 2 has a system for this, and the old guild wars 1 game (GVG) had this.   If we had those changes the tournaments I feel like it would be much more popular and give pros something to actually play for.
I've seen teams go into the third period of games in their yellow nemesis' barn up 3-1 before. It's not a lock for the Jets yet.
This is a nice PSA. I’m discovering even if you buy a pellicle/SCOBY, you still have to wait just as long for  new one to form on top of your brew. So, just save money and grow your own from a bottle of GTs 😉
I’d generally agree. Are you contending he doesn’t do that?
I'm not very knowledgeable about guns so I don't know the names of them all but he said AR-15s have nothing on his stuff. He had about 10 pistols big and small, about 5 big assault rifles one of them was a vector and I have no idea what the other ones were but the manuals all had swat pictures on them and shit. He also had every accessory imaginable. I forgot to mention this kids pretty wealthy and he usually splurges on weird shit but this is strange because he got this then right when his gf broke up with him and he's not in the right mental state to have these guns
I was the kid with allergy problems that were not addressed. I would pick my boogers and stick them on the wall. If I sneezed from allergies I would pull my shirt to my nose and have a river of boogers on my chest... ew. Or I would sneeze on my arm and get it all over my sleeves. You would think I didn’t know tissues existed lol.   I also have ears that my parents never cleaned. My wax is dry and white and flakes and scabs in my ears. So... I would use my pinkies to pick my ears and sniff the wax.   Maybe that’s why I didn’t have any friends.

Yeah, last I checked, ballroom gowns weren’t an appropriation of French culture, so a qipao isn’t appropriation of Chinese culture.   And let’s be real.  Cultural appropriation is just a code word to excuse the lefts desire to create a segregated, tribalistic society.  How’s that working for South Africa?

That’s completely incorrect. You’re not very good at debating are you? Read a fucking book?
> I'm a Democrat, and I favor the idea of a regional solution over a city solution.    If you’re interested in the perspective of one unincorporated Snohomish County resident....  (50 miles, as the crow flies, from downtown Seattle).   How are you going to get us to vote for that regional solution? Some of our drug addicts are probably in Seattle, but most of that is probably due to geography (long walk to the dealer, or even a  grocery store), social services spread out, no buses, etc. Couple that with our enforcement of laws, they go elsewhere. Probably to Seattle.    Why would County residents vote for a Seattle-style money-sink that shows little results?
Precisely: current technologies track motion controllers quite well, but don’t track arms at all; in VR this results in wrong visual feedback that ruins the experience.  A lot of VR experiences avoid also the use of 3D hand models at all, preferring virtual models of the used motion controllers for the same reason: hands are usually “faked” and the feeling is not exceptional, for some interactive experiences showing to the user the motion controller he/she is using in the real world improve the “virtual handling abilities “.
See, but you're assuming. They showed me NONE of that on screen. As far as they showed us/informed us Holdo knew and Leia knew...everyone else was in the dark. But not only that they weren't even told there WAS a plan. Poe even says "Just tell me there is a plan"...and nada. That's a recipe for mutiny and death.  The movie has to communicate these things to me if they are THIS important to the overall plot. The movie did not do that.  And my grandad was IN the D-Day landings, so I don't need you to tell me about them.
They're probably doing this to generate hype for the FLCL 2 premiere after that week.

Baron Corbin. The only reason I can give is that his old NXT entrance with the spotlights leading to centerstage always looked so goddamn stupid to me. It looked like he needed to be led to the ring. That's literally the only reason I dislike him, and it's a really dumb reason.  Killer Elite Squad. I just do not enjoy them on my screen. The only time I'll watch them is when they're in a multi-man with the rest of Suzuki-gun. I skip their regular tag matches which means the tag division in NJPW recently has been hell for me.
It was't my intent to try to fear-monger or demonize you, but I can see that my comment is out of line and I apologize.     Basically, I'm always struck on how hardline anti-trans rhetoric is almost entirely focused against AMAB transgender persons. Basically, no matter how much we work to transition, we will always be "men" and thus are a threat to ciswomen, whether in public, in restrooms, or in prisons.     But, transgender men are almost never considered. I don't want to think about what TERFs and the like think about transgender men, but I can't imagine they'd be any more happy with the thought of sharing restrooms, prisons, and private spaces with transmen. But, if we apply their logic that people need to segregate based on their birth gender rather than gender identity, then transmen are forced into female-only spaces.     So, I'm trying to call out the hypocrisy of anti-trans activists, not demean transmen. But I see your point and again I apologize.

He's not trolling you at all. High alching is considered AFK in RS.  You're taking the term too literally. In osrs, AFK means something that requires very little attention or input by the user to do. high alching is AFK because all you have to do is click in the same exact spot. It doesn't require your undivided attention.  To answer your question, there is no cheap way to train mage at NMZ. This is why the guy that you think is trolling you is suggesting other ways to train your magic that don't cost an arm and a leg. Because you don't have a lot to spend
Persinger's work is great. I have a crown he did and he also fixed some sub\-par dental work that another dentist did, and the difference is night and day.  Also, when I saw him offering reduce or free care here \(not to suggest that he'll do that all the time\) he earned my loyalty for good.
*I need mental help?* Am I the one who has been incessantly posting for karma grabs for 4 years?  I’ve been here for just over a week and have noticed these patterns of karmawhoring very quickly (such is the result of having a very high IQ - rapid pattern recognition is a huge aspect, and you can look this up in multiple highly-cited articles).  So don’t try to play this on me. Karmawhores should be more self-aware of their addiction and do what they can to correct it.
Unown and Mr. Mime are always going to haunt me, I saw them in gyms so their silhouettes in the Pokédex are going to give me sad feels for a long long time. I wish they would only count Pokémon you can catch for yourself towards the Pokédex and not other people’s Pokémon in gyms.
That's what downvotes are for
>Overall, I'd say Maple and Caps have both been S tier so far, after that BDD in A tier, Xiaohu in B tier, Warzone in C tier and finally Pobelter in NA tier  I think i will put Xiaohu and BDD in the same tier
What’s this? We have a decent looking attack for once?
This is so absurd I had to take a blood-pressure pill. Seems to me the ideal situation in California is to ensure that you kill anyone who breaks in.
You don't have to invent it to see the obvious advantages of it and also educate other people about it. Seriously, are you propsing the only country allowed to market/promote/spread an idea or system is the one it originated from? Well hate to break it to ya, but almost all of american systems were adapted from abroad.
France is too slow and boring, Israel has no energy in performance, but could score with weirdness and the immense hype. I see that Germany could do well, personally I write if off because it sounds like a rip-off of several recent songs.  My guess for the win is either Ireland (despite a clicheed chorus), Cyprus (despite bad vocals), Sweden, Bulgaria or Norway (due to eastern support). Hungary would be fun, too, but I think it is a bit too out there.
Yeah, my username on it is cakes4fatpeople.
Like he said about giving him 50 days after demonetisation and that he is ready to face consequences but he later retracting not to judge him based on that?
Mahrez is awesome, prefer him to sterling - hard to link in a hybrid tho
I run with r4 5* duped x-23. She definitely ends fights too fast to get a decent amount of regen. However, I prefer ending quickly to prevent health lost. My alliance runs 5x5 and we hit 125m milestone with that. Unless I have an extremely off day X-23 gets me through the whole map. FYI I do not have a 5* rogue and have never used my 4* in AQ as it is not r5.   Pro tip: if you use X-23 and take science line in 2nd section of map 5 you can take YJ linked (+300% health) to heal up as the fight lasts long enough.
Not really, follow up ring blows the +10 out of the water. The problem with Altwen is that you are putting a huge amount of weight on Thunderhead when it’s literally just a refined bladetome (+1 damage), plus her 30/35 offensive spread, which are good, but barely better than a Gunnthra (31/33) who also comes with chilling seal, which more than makes up for the slightly lower speed (and the +1 Attack covers the difference between Thunderhead and Gronnblade, not that you’d usually run it over blizzard, but in terms of raw performance a blade Gunnthra outperforms Altwen assuming the same boons/banes and build, trading the expected desperation for chilling seal).
So you can't imagine anything in-between do nothing and assault the child?
It's not going to be with him - last rumors said Jacquin Phoenix (or however is name is spelled)
Mini boards has almost no flex in general.  So just as well as the Wowgo.
“mr stark, I don’t feel so good...”
My favorite is "Dominoes Pizza House" in Stephenville Newfoundland. It is in no way associated with the major chain and the stephenville location existed first so they won a lawsuit years ago to keep the name going. They make decent pizza but it's got sort of an aquired taste, you probably won't love it the first time but it grows on you. Their prices are also crazy cheap and they put a mountain of toppings on. Its usually my first food stop whenever I visit.
Ofcourse coming from a MI fan when NOHIT himself goes out for Duck.
I'm not even close to being an expert on this.  > How is one treated after being excommunicated?  The Orthodox does not shun excommunicated people.   The excommunicated is still welcome to Church, fellowship, and so on, but can not partake of communion till they are restored to full communion.  > What must be done to heal relationships with the church as to be recommuned?  Confession.  Time of repentance might be needed.  Ceasing whatever sin caused the excommunication.  Making reparations, like turning yourself in, if you committed murder.
I agree, I have found my favorite subreddit ever!!! You guys are my people!! ❤️
in case u support u're not only supportin' the player u want but the event as a whole... guess the idea is they invite the players one would most likely want to watch first and then there's chances to get someone u might want to see in if u get some merchandise...  puttin' groups within the community against each other sounds a bit like paranoia... it's not a war, kinda don't think anyone would die if his/hers player doesn't make it in, u don't need to sell ur house or get in debts to support someone else.  if u can and want, u just buy somethin' u might wear later on, give ur votes to whom u might want to support and also support the event itself.  if u can't or just don't want to support but are still interested, u might still be able to tune in and watch as most of the more skilled players in the game are bein' flown in already   what's so scummy about pullin' out an event of such production size and try to use some community support to not do it at a loss?   no one is obligated to support, hence seems actually scummy to just "boycott" the event just because.  how many ppl have fuckin' 50+ spent in Chun Li costumes, but consider a sin to throw another 50 to help an event like this happen [](/BrokeBack)
Didn’t seem that way, it looks like in private they are very close
Beauty, eh‽
I assume you didn’t agree, since you posted it.   Just saying my opinion.
Syfy has a bunch of decent to good shows: The Magicians, Happy!, Krypton, Channel Zero, 12 Monkeys (might be ending soon, can't remember), Nightflyers (coming up, looks pretty interesting).  But yeah, idk why they wouldn't keep The Expanse.
Asking the impt questions here
I still feel a sting out of this outcome, to be honest.  That despite this outpouring from the fans, this clear want for more of Rays' story, they're still going to cut off the WW audience.  I mean, I get it.  It did not make enough money.  But I wish they'd at least try to stick it out and see if things get any better by pushing out a bit of Mirrage Prison, the app's overall improvements, and the split in gacha currency.
We see amazing things on this sub a lot, but a huge amount of them are planned. No matter how mind blowing they are, if you know they're just a trick, it's hard to get excited. Meanwhile, seeing a coincidence like this—that you usually only see in a movie—is extraordinary. Magic comes from serendipity.
phenibut should be avoided prior to attempting a K hole, because your memory will suck so bad it will feel like you just passed out and wasted 200mg of K.  Also if you wanna trully experience K holes magic, you should IM it. When snorted a ton of K is converted to noketamine which several time less potent.  Also I wosh I knew where to find a vendor for racemic Ketamine, S isomer is good and all, but I remeber much trippier K hole my first few time with ketamine, and wonder if it was Racemic instead of S isomer.
It’s 9000% hacked having Pokérus and level 100 like that is a dead giveaway
Get drunk and pretend the crowd is playing dodge ball and every single one of them is wearing a "mike alstott sucks" shirts
Repeatables are really strong though and the unity edicts can give you significant bonuses, especially if you pick civics and perks that increase their durations, allowing you to keep all of them rolling at once.
“seems like she knew Aric was replacing her and not very happy with him.”  That’s a pretty big assumption right there. I remember reading somewhere that she didn’t think she was getting replaced until the June/July.  She was just in a major crash and probably wasn’t even thinking anything else than what just happened. Then, she was asked a question. Joey also had the least hardest hit and was positioned to view the whole thing. I mean what, did you want her to run over to Aric and extract him herself until you were satisfied with her?  Honestly, when I was watching this whole thing I wasn’t focused on who said or didn’t say what and just was hoping everyone was okay. I didn’t know that everyone was bitching about this until coming on here to read reactions about the wreck.  I can’t believe that in this situation this is when you keep her at your highest standard.
Yessssss that's why I didn't mention that one lmao
Oh the CGI versions of seasons 1-3 can absolutely go screw. The ones on iTunes in the UK do at least have the original model shots.
Not sure how that’s relevant.
Had a similar issue , I have a gigabyte connection and was getting 10-15meg up and down. Cause was a bad cat 5 line
yup we're in midterm season while these jackasses are getting out of school
Damn, my buddy made E-5 in the Navy in like 3 years.  He went from a pretty decent guy to play WOW with to someone who thought he should be leading raids.  Dude you were fucking machinist mate, not Chesty Puller of online RPGS.
Oh yeah. The headaches started with the high BP and haven’t let up. They get slightly better with low light and caffeine, but they are mostly a constant feeling of pressure and fullness. Like an allergy headache combined with a low grade migraine. Starts somewhere around 10 am and is worst in the afternoon and then again before bed.   I had regular migraines before getting pregnant (and ironically, was on a medication for LOW blood pressure for a few years that helped manage migraines) but that’s one thing I NEVER had while pregnant. I didn’t have so much as a minor headache until the blood pressure started.   Are they monitoring you weekly? Have they checked that baby is growing okay? Those were the first things they did after putting me on labetalol.   The good thing to keep in mind is that your baby is viable and the statistics are good for survival without major medical problems, even if you delivered today. If the symptoms are getting overwhelming, don’t be afraid to let your doctor know that! The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. I know I’m less afraid of that now after dealing with the possibility of delivering so early, and seeing some of the stories of premature babies born on this sub.
It’s a mirror bogo. Just got one delivered last week and compared it to my retail and the blank is almost spot on. Thank you tho guys I’m gonna GL.
Kisses from a nana... I’m happy for you. You’re a beautiful soul. Now smile and go make the life you want..., no more time for bs
I think they should just extend the current 10XX series. So few people who actually wanted one were able to purchase one in the past 6 months at a reasonable price. They could wait until Q1 2019 for their next release with how well they’ll be selling while in stock.
Oh my god Jinder is gonna get over as a face...
I don’t think anyone would argue you on that.
Yeah, that's some PTSD shit like the other poster said. Check out the book "Save the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won't Save Black America" by Dr Stacey Patton. therapy and meds can help!
I would say Trolleh is a big part of the problem aswell, he has adapted well to NA, Throwbelter still lifting most of the weight for the zeroandten dream since Trolleh decided to not play for a game. The last game vs FNC I really tought for a second Trolleh was cosplaying the late Yellowstar, combo'ing a Braum in lane only to get his adc in a almost certain death position he really deserves some credit aswell, he's trying so hard to catch up to throwbelter.
> To blindly say that Australian gun laws aren’t working isn’t really acknowledging the full context.  That's something you'll find on both sides of the issue. Our discourse now is fact-free and 100% of truthiness and emotions.
Killzone was badass
God damn it, not this still. I DESPISE DWing as a DK, and I don't want pets constantly either. But what really hit the nail in the coffin for me when Legion started was what they did to Frostmourne, reducing it to such insulting mockeries called the Blades of the Fallen Prince. That really hurt so much, especially since it was insulting the ENTIRE Death Knight class as a whole. I really hope they fix that and turn what I feel is the worst artifact in the game \(at least appearance and thematic\-wise\) back into Frostmourne. If not, and we STILL get stuck with DW instead of getting 2H back, should we start trying a BringBack2HFrost hastag or something? I hope we can do SOMETHING about 2H Frost and properly restoring Frostmourne though.
Easily my capstone design class - the professor was an absolute dickhead and kept changing what he wanted from us.  In the end he wanted all sorts of writeups from us - basically a page of writing for every meeting we had, written out explanations of all of our designs, from preliminary stages up to the finished product, hard copies of all of our emails pertaining to the project, and more.  I eventually just said fuck it and threw all my papers in a binder and took my D for that class.  I was otherwise an A/B student, was in honor societies, graduated with Latin honors, and all that. But that class was so bad that it sapped any caring I had about it completely out of me.
How is this material for this subreddit? I mean, it’s cringe, but it’s not intended to be deep.
One of my favorites as well! If you haven't done it yet, give Rockbound Lake a visit. It's a bit of a boring long trail of long, gradual switchbacks but it's nestled in the bowl on the other side. You can also hike up Helena Ridge which is on the back side and summit 3 or 4 peaks from there. To the lake and back is 24kms so give yourself lots of time and snack breaks. She's a long day!
I bought a ptr91a3 from then recently. No issues.  Shipped to my FFL in a week.
The feeeeeeeels
After they won his arb case (he wanted $5m, NYY offered $3m) Randy Levine made unsolicited comments about how that's closer money and Dellin isn't that good.
Dont blame you I’m a dick and I’d rather just be burned and thrown in the bin
Not United fan, but I think they might fill their RW hole by using Martial + cash for Pulisic as others have mentioned above
wait will this be like Lost Sphear, wherein they released an english patch for those bought in japanese region
and that's if the cocksucker in the front is paying attention and actually goes when the light turns green.  Typically they take off so slow and late that only 4 cars get through. I'm looking at you Baseline westbound, turning onto Greenbank sounthbound.    Argh, I need my medication.
I like assassin's dagger and the impaler. And the infantry bow, not even joking.

I had a girlfriend a few years back that was r e a l l y sexual. And I had to constantly tell her to not touch me down there in public. Of course, I let it happen most times, but sometimes no that you lmao
Srsly tho someone explain this
The standard mag version is 91152. CZ SKUs starting with a 0 denote the low cap model.   But it’s interesting you were able to get a standard mag version.
I know you are talking about Ragù alla Bolognese. Yes, the Artusi recipe which was one of the first did not have tomatoes. But from what I have read, tomatoes were added by subsequent chefs and are now considered a typical part of Bolognese.   Anyways, that's what I have learned from researching this. I went on a kick of researching authentic Italian recipes a while back. I don't disagree, the Artusi recipe didn't have tomatoes. But usually now as I understand it, even in Bologna, bolognese is quite often if not usually made with tomato.
Good save on the original “are you retarded” comment.   *looks at picture again*  Okay, now what?
That is why i said moneygrabs instead of p2w. Still way to much microtransactions. Eg. Wow you have to buy the game, dlc, pay a monthly sub to get all the content and by the end of that there are also microtransactions. if you compare that with swtor (made by bioware owned by EA) which is star wars copy of WoW you get everything through subscription and everything that is not in the dlcs (which you get for free for subscribing) are f2p with so much content and it also has microtransactions but mostly cosmetics. Overwatch is a 60€ with lootboxes just like battlefront 2 was at its launch but yeah that is only cosmetics. Hearthstone is literally as p2w as it gets but most people seem to be fine with as it is a f2p game.
OMG GUYS WTFFFFF REDDIT SAID MY INTERNETS GETTING DEDLETED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sounds familiar. It’s more of an unspoken rule but it’s there!
Madrid's full-backs are so good making forward runs.
tbh I'd love to see Aria and Dawn of Sorrow. After I've seen that DS intro for DoS, I was amazed and at the same time disappointed there isnt an animation series done for it.
🌟🌟🌟🌟 Congrats 👏 deff the best team in Europe this year absolutely deserve it.
bro its just my first impression of it. And it is the most "monotone" bladee project so far
No... The best we can do: 🦆💋
Too old. He’ll be dead soon.
Since this is "legaladviceofftopic" I'm allowed to do this:  I don't know the answer, so I can't help you here -- but I must say that's one incredibly interesting question. (At least, it's right up my alley; maybe not everyone would find it interesting but I certainly do.)
You can spell sssss if u posted this the Best Buy in Richmond Virginia.
Maybe you are good at the game but that’s just because you are a cunt
it's not what you think 😓
murai shouldn't have a beard because he's strict and beucock should be fat because i said so.  while the introduction of the rosenritters in the ova showed a certain side of them (that schenkopp is a dress chaser lmao) i actually enjoyed more the one in this series (even though they gave blumhart a fucking beard).   i wonder why people don't understand the the entire gig was a joke, even when greenhill flipped the guy i'm pretty sure he let her.  it's a way of showing that these guys don't give a fuck and like to joke around, it's extremely prevalent throughout the entire story.
There's one point he makes that I totally agree with. To have real change we need governments representing their people both in Baku and Irevan.
Happy cakeday!
They literally had no choice. Plus, they were trying to save Trunks’s world. Even then, in the comic, Gokou and Vegeta were going to challenge the infinite amount of Potara Zamasu with the little power they had. That shows you that they don’t back down.  You picked one situation out of the entirety of Dragon Ball. In the Universe Survival Arc, Gokou was trying to fight Jiren even after he lost against him, especially the first time after using Ultra Instinct -Sign-.
Have you first finished getting the free mats from some mission rewards for Ch.5/6/7 Hard Mode?
No problem. Shes tried everything before mylan too from Tramadol, Lortab, Barbituate/caffine mix and some other stuff I forgot the name off but the non narcotic mylan did it best.
I’d put Spider-Man one above as I think he stopped Cull Obsidian punch to Iron Man.
First one definitely: Pikkon + piccolo > pikkon + vegeta And that’s the important thing
mixed feelings now since I took a tip from a reply; that is to check the top team overall.  there were tons of teams with the punisher. dumbfounded right now but since he also is a blaster, might as well try pushing him up.
Sadly some cunt would shoot one at the moon and we’d all get sucked out. It would be a new form of terrorism. Shoot one at the moon and then go to a large crowd and shoot it at the ground.  Poof 207 people gone in a flash.   I’m over thinking this. Sorry
Haha yeah I killed like 6 plesioths today trying to get through 6 star g rank, I feel your pain on a deep level my friend.
I didn't imagine it sounds so dramatically to other people.  I started eating "clean" ever since I had gastritis. I got used of eating simple and not so much at a time.  I have a great full breakfast, fruits or yoghurt during the day. Full and great lunch with salads and then my last meal of the day  is grilled chickrn or beef with salad.   It really sounds nice to me.   I love bread tho so from this point of view I suffer.
Yeah I'll try different strats before settling for one

Wrong subreddit.  Not politics.
* he's probably at home? The dude did just lost an election. And,  * didn't the Raja Bomoh also competed in this election? Did he win?
Subtlety is subjective, though. What in your eyes can be pure escapism can be seen as a clearly stated message in others.   Even a relatively "harmless" storyline like the Armor Wars can be re\-read under a political lens... I mean, the Armor Wars can be summed up as "Heroic US businessman valiantly fights against those gubbmint bastards". Keep in mind that I still think it's a classic storyline, but in my non\-US opinion it's a product of Reagan's era America, and it shows.
I actually coined a term for this while watching a freak play during the Super Bowl. This fella has a tremendous niggability!
Thank you man! I really do feel like that was a good choice. Took my mind off of it and I improved myself a little bit. It’s just so hard not to chase girls! I don’t know why! Congrats on the streak! Almost to a week!!!! You got it dude!

Thank you so much, spacebetweentime (I love that, by the way)   Keep reading! This is a special place and I also have benefited so much from what people have been willing to share.
We have S+ on our PvE Island Server. Agree with you. But for pvp, we prefer to keep the easy-cheats away, and the skills high! It's a survival game. You can't have a professional nanny, gardener, and house cleaner on a pvp server... At least ours anyway...  To each their own!
Absolutely nothing I’m afraid, they obviously don’t care!

The last month or so Baka has looked a better player and I can’t wait to see him next year.   But I’ve watched every game he has played and here your telling me that a compilation of 8 minutes is proof that Baka has played well this season ?    You’ve got my downvote.
Hello there,  I would recommend to anybody this phone, user experience is awesome, very bright display, great battery life and camera, solid phone. I use it with a case and screen protector (just my preference), few drops from 1m and some water spilled on it, works perfectly fine.   I use it for massive multitasking, charge it in the morning and after 6pm because it's always on, I get between 4h - 5h30min. SOT. Oreo is here, soon for all the unlock ones, the software is very good on Android 7.0. Here it is around 370 euros, best bang for the buck for me.  Have a great day, Victor
I use it in all my campaigns. In contrast to what CrappyBark says, I find the Subjective morality system incredibly easy to implement and it makes for much more interesting stories. I still remember the first time my Inquisitor player used detect evil, and my response was, "He does not detect as evil... to you." It was at that moment that the concept of subjective morality really clicked for the players, and they had to start thinking about the villains more in the sense of what they did and why instead of evil/not evil.
But you get a bonus for them simply being there. I prefer them over the fuckers who fly everywhere with their deluxo and blow up the mission objective half the time...

I agree 100% and the funny/weird thing is how incongruous it is with the rest of the media's focus on #MeToo and showing respect for women.
It's just a nagging "what if" kind of thing. Not so much that its creating some kind of void in my life or makes me unhappy, but its just...there....  Mind you this event was 20 years ago, but it's something I know I fucked up. There is no way of correcting it, but feels kinda good to just let it out there to some internet stangers.
Not seeing the picture viewing this in chrome, but hopefully its there. Its from Pokemon Trading Card Game 2. I was on the plane playing this and started laughing out loud when I saw Volderp there on the screen.
Some sort of square, maybe a torpedo level, utility knife, pencil/sharpie, small pry bar, some type of pliers- that's all I can think of right now
I have thought about that too, but then I was thinking about which came first, the phobia or the realization that I couldn't burp? I think it was the burp thing. I remember the phobia started around 12 so they are on a slightly similar timeline. Maybe it is the other way around than what you say, When you were a kid you never burped so anything coming up meant that you were throwing up, which was BAD. So then future you associated the feeling of something coming up being BAD, so you held it and your burp muscle never developed. Who knows though? I will say that if I really wanted to I could get the Botox but I am scared that somewhere in the process I will V*. I know my life would be drastically better if I could burp but I can't get past the fear. Currently realizing all of this stuff and I just started therapy for it so maybe I will be in Chicago getting the injections someday.   Also another of my theories is that with tight upper LES as a no burper, the V*ing is a worse and more painful experience so that is where the phobia starts, but you are living proof that you don't have a problem with that. Hm.
Get these hecking swears off my memes
There is physical and historical evidence documented that is dated and was written about at the time of when he existed.  For Jesus we have Writings about a historical event 80 years later by folks who weren’t there.  So how is that more proof of existence? Early Romans were very good at documentation yet we have nothing from that time.    If 2,000 years from now there was a religion that said an omnipotent deity ruled America in the 1980s but the earliest writing of this ruler is written about is only found in the year 2050 and none of the newspapers, online, books etc mention it,  you can’t say that was for certain.  That’s what we have with a Jesus.
The Rook and Stilletto by Daniel O’Malley. The first is 17 hours which is pretty decent. Stiletto (second in the series) is 23. Think X Men meets British spy stories and you’ll have a pretty good idea of the series, but add a lot of weird but good humor.   The Name of the Wind is like 27 hours I believe.   Crime and Punishment is 20 hours. A lot of other classics are long too.
Panasonic 12-60 f3.5-5.6? Still sealed, even better range, kinda overpriced for a kit zoom IMO but there's probably split kit deals on eBay or somewhere. I mean you aren't gonna get f2.8 in a lighter or cheaper lens, the 12-35 is somewhat smaller and I've always liked it a little better for that tho I don't care for f2.8 standard zooms all that much (at least on M4/3).
I’m buying something wearable off amazon right now.   Better yet I’m buying from American As Fuck   Donald Pump, or George Washinguns?
Read that as “Skin Girls Club” and wondered if it was some sort of Texas chainsaw massacre show.
Long haul drivers are the absolutely best bros on the road, if you show them respect and aren't total dicks to them. I always try to let them move/merge as I can, and I've seen them pay it forward to other drivers 100x over. When people in cars calm the fuck down and realize that semis have a tugboat's worth of trailer they have to manuever through traffic (while dealing with asshole drivers, tight deadlines, stingent regulations, and 10 hour driving days on a daily basis), it really puts things in perspective.    Local drivers, especially here in Chicago area, can mostly suck horribly though, and I have no sympathy for them.

The initial implementation of PBMM was just that, initial. We can see that they don't feel it is ready yet, and I imagine they learned a lot from the week or so it was live.   It is very difficult for AI to know good from bad, especially for things like tank anchoring and split pushing. But these ARE things that can be learned. This such a heavily team-based game that currently only rewards rank based on win/loss, and this is the biggest reason for MM frustration.   A solid PBMM implementation could be perfect to mitigate the inevitable situations where we play in teams that lack basic understanding / afk / trolling / feeding, but its something that requires refinement over time.   Often people gravitate to absolutes and instant gratification and this mindset sabotages goal oriented gradual progress. How long did you take to teach your fingers to write legibly?
I would like to add that I am young (early 20’s) all my friends are also young for the most part. We all went to college, we have good jobs and we all have guns. Some hunt, me personally I just shoot targets/self defense. But I also live in a no carry state. All my friends and my self are part of 2A activist groups, but we really don’t mention it because of the negativity it holds in the common public eye. Just food for thought.

Vornheim sounds like an excellent resource. It's not available to download/buy in my neck of the woods. Will up my GoogleFoo.
Thanks for your answer. I suppose I’m asking, that, as far as I understand, observing collapses the wave probability function - given this is this universal? So if it is observed by one person, is the consequence of that observation felt by all parties - even those who don’t if there was an observation?  Also, sorry for reposting the same comment, just want to make sure I get myself across.
It’s a coordinated effort. Sowing racial tensions is an attack. It’s unbelievable that you feel otherwise and it shows where your sympathies lay, and it’s not with the US.
Are you able to even get past the típ??? Wholly crap thats huge. Probably make them pass out. Lucky guy

Hey baby, if you woke up today, it’s a good day.

Im trying to explain arguments. I dont nesisarily believe anything here.   Providing examples would make this easier for people to argue about since these are soundbites...but...  “Man abandons child, womans fault” This could mean a few different things but from experience id guess its likley connected to race. Eg the white woman is at fault for choosing a black man, so why is she suprised he left.  For a non racist version simply sub black man for drug dealer, scumbag, guy on welfare etc etc. when an average women choses to have kids with a man who is obviously a bad choice its kinda her fault since she should have seen this coming and made better decisions. The drug dealer is already garbage and it’s unreasonable to expect him to be faithful or responsible.  “Marriage fell apart, woman chose wrong” I dont actually think this is an argument made by anyone ever. (THIS IS WHY EXAMPLES ARE GOOD). The actual argument being made is likely based around women using divorce as a weapon and ending marriage to break men, take the kids and take his money. This is an argument that gets made a lot and is far simpler. If a woman marries a wealthier man, then divorces him later with the intent to profit off it (see trophy wives who make millions) it’s obviously her fault.  “Fathers and alcoholic, woman chose wrong” This ties in heavily with the first one but is far clearer cut. If a woman meets a man who is an alcoholic and then chooses to marry him and have a kid with him how is it not her fault that the father of her child is an alcoholic? The fathers alchoholism is the fathers fault, but the fact that hes the father of her kid is her fault. So in reverse.  “A man marries a drug addicted woman and has kids with her. She shirks her responsibility to look after said kids (since she doesnt work in this example) cause shes on drugs and they drown in the bath”.   Now in that individual situation the woman is at fault since she was too high to keep her kids safe. But big picture what do you expect when you have children with an active drug user, that man should have made a better decision.

Honestly I can't understand....aside from racist views that they think its acceptable...but how is tRump praised as more of a hero than McCain? I'm not a fan and while he could have done a lot more to hold his party to a higher standard sooner, he's a fucking Vietnam Vet and a Hero to me for his service.   Yet cadet Bonespurs dodge the draft multiple times, and has said the same remarks about McCain.. Claims to care about Vets yet what has really changed... So unless you tell me the real reason tRump has more credibility than McCain in that sense.... Fuck off
It. Just. Happens.  We don't design the modules. We can't tell you a reason why they lose time, only that it happens. You seem unable to accept that they just lose time. Yes yes yes, we get it, it was perfectly on time for weeks, and now it's not. It just happens. Maybe it's a voltage drop in the battery, maybe it's just a random glitch. Whatever it is, it happens, it's normal, stop acting like everyone can't understand you, we get what you are saying just fine.  You're on track to losing 2 seconds a month. A Rolex isn't that accurate. Basically the only thing more accurate than that is a high end quartz movement and atomic clocks. Just accept that it lost a second and move on. The watch can survive WW3 with out a scratch, just accept that it loses time in random ways already.
AS4 needs to give us a Kameron vs. Trinity Taylor lip sync. *especially since they robbed us of Chi Chi/Kennedy*
Would be better phrased as ' to prevent network flooding'. There are two separate meanings here, and it stems from yet another of Blockstreams deliberate equivocations.  Spam as used commonly, has a negative connotation with e-mail or unwanted solicitation. Bitcoin however is a economic system and not strictly a messaging medium. Transactions have a cost. These costs go to miners, who protect the system. Ergo any transaction paying a fee is helping secure the network and by definition not spam.      The issue with 'flooding': it's more like a DoS attack, so many ~~spam~~ flood transactions that the network begins to buckle. The original design foresaw this, and like many problems, Bitcoin uses economics as the solution. With significantly sized blocks and a (non worthless) coin price, this attack vector becomes prohibitively expensive.

Well I assume it’s similar to the strategy deployed by RT of highlighting and promoting divisive issues, exaggerating racial issues, brewing civil unrest, etc. the Russians are very good at this and have used the strategy in plenty of countries they’ve tried to influence. Funny thing is if you watch RT you’d swear Russia was a bastion of freedom, progressive thinking, racial/ethnic/social unity and egalitarianism, and that the US economy has imploded several times over
I’m pretty sure Tower is called Tower because it’s based on Mok Myeok Tower.   Also Skyscraper was already taken. But it actually just makes sense when it’s already based on a place called Tower.

I'd recommend either the new lh realm coming in 4-5 weeks (I think) or Kronos 3, both are good options. It's very likely that the lh realm will be the most popular server until classic wow (basically, nostalrius-core projects (the previous one being elysium, right after nostalrius shut down) tend to get most of the players.  I don't think there's a wrong choice between the two though: Kronos has been around for a very long time, and they're a viable choice, it's just that you'll have considerably less people online on it, but that might be a good thing: some people don't like super big servers.

Plants with fatter leaves and stems need less water because they can store more water. Soil needs to dry to the bottom not just the surface. If you're still having problems, avoid getting water between leaves on on the stem or water from the bottom. Humidity can also be a problem if there is no air current where you are growing. A small fan or opening a door or window can also help. Also increasing the ammount of Perlite or other grit in your mix can help with overwatering.
Well, the ads were to get data, not to influence. That's what most of those memehouses do. They get people to sign up for their pages and then sell data for ad targeting and ad space on their pages.
This nose looks less like a discovery and more like the engineers went: “Mercedes is fast and their nose has a cape and a narrow-ed waist, Red Bull is fast and their nose-tip has a duct, and Sauber has gotten faster and their nose has nostrils. So let’s throw all of them in.”   I’m sure the engineers worked hard and this nose might represent real gains, but I still thinks it looks like a mish-mash if everyone else’s noses.
Wow, that's awful 😔
But how did he take the picture if the camera is on a trypod?
While I agree with you in some respects, imo Cloud 9 didn't deserve to get out of groups in the past two worlds and be top 8 teams. 2016 worlds they had a bottom tier chinese team who fielded a sub and played pretty poorly. Then they had Flash wolves who not only lost to the Chinese team, but played one of the worst games with the infamous Meteos kick.  2017 was a smilar story with EDG inconsistency and AHQ offering little resistance.  2014 they definitly deserved it though.

> You don't use a line graph because the data points aren't really related to eachother.  I started with a line graph because I wanted to visually see the "x upgrade to x+1 tier" relationship between orb tiers I interpreted slipperjim's results to represent (it would have shown as a general upward slope like the way things look for GCP and up in his graph). However, I dropped that narrative once I saw his results in the graph, and then I just stuck with the line graph for my data afterwards because it was familiar and I could quickly compare and look for any consistency in my attempt to reproduce his results.  > no one is normalizing their actual data on a per map basis  I honestly don't understand how number of maps is made to be so important in all these conversations. The event being measured is actually a monster death (which may or may not result in a loot drop), not a map or instance being opened.  Though I must admit your idea behind using SD to calculate the number of tests required to go beyond "noise" is a good one. I'd encourage you or someone else to give it a try. It may seem like a daunting task at the outset, but there is a lot of prestige to be had if you can prove everyone wrong. And the independent results around IIR's effects have been fairly consistent, if sometimes communicated a bit poorly and misleadingly.
I’m in the midst of the Clockwork story now, and while it doesn’t have the breadth of Orsinium’s story, the writing is just as good if not better. Especially if your take the time to read some of the texts lying around, it paints this picture of a really creepy, steampunk, mysterious-overseers-of-the-vault kind of thing.

FWIW, some of the “nicer” outlets have actual outlet pieces, and better quality stuff. There’s a DVF outlet in San Marcos which I loved, and a Bebe outlet (maybe it’s gone now), I was working at Bebe at the time and it was crazy because everything we had in stock currently at our store was also at the outlet, but 40% off (and iirc, I got an additional 20% off for employee discount). It was nuts. Sure, they had their 2B stuff which was trash, but I was amazed at how cheap their current line stuff was. Maybe it’s why they closed :(
You'll get no argument from me.    For building and terraforming, the editor is great. A few bugs and quirks here and there, but the functionality is spot-on.   When it comes to gameplay, however, I think the best way to describe it is *skeletal*.     I'm certain they have every intention of expanding upon the options we have, with regard to control over NPCs, objectives and conditions/triggers, given the presentation (an entire Arcade section) and the inclusion of Arcade machines in the campaign map.   It just wouldn't make sense to draw such attention to a feature you don't have faith in, or plans for.

They were scumbags to begin with. Why give a damn about how THEY feel?  1. They entered that mission to primarily to farm.  2. They fully expected you to carry the mission for them, or if you didn't, they would leave, and re-enter another public mission and expect the same thing. Rinse and repeat.  3. Them going into a mission while being SEVERELY underleveled is already horrendously inconsiderate of THEM. They are doing this knowingly and players like this are exploiting thousands upon thousands of players.   4. If they were that spiteful over just a single storm chest, that clearly points out that that chest was the sole thing they were concerned with, and that they had zero intention whatsoever of putting up a significant, or any effort towards the objective. Also, ensuring that the mission would fail over a sabotaged storm chest that they couldn't even destroy themselves with 2 people, is the definite example of someone who hates it when things don't go their way, and they'll get their way by any means necessary.  5. The only thing that a person who exploits others can understand is being exploited themselves or having someone consistently ruin their plans. Being nice gets you nowhere with these kind of people, because that's precisely what they want, and will use that against you. It's like a manipulative ex that tries to convince you that you were the problem in your relationship, and not at all them.   6. Screw these kind of people and give them a taste of their own misery until they can no longer stomach it or they move on to some other game. It's perfectly fine to be spiteful of people who are nothing but a negative influence in your experience of something or just life in general, especially if you are normally a perfectly rational, considerate, kind, and decent individual.   There are better things to do than dwelling on what people of such poor character would feel after doing something to upset them (unless you're legitimately concerned they might do something to you as a result).
Funny enough i asked my religious friend this and she responded with to be with god. She asked me why i’m an Atheist. I responded with a question. I asked her if i told her i could teleport anywhere would she believe me? She said “of course not! Unless you have proof!”. Then i asked her so why should i believe in god without proof then?
I was very much against the Rose signing, but he proved me wrong in his short stint he was well worth the roster spot.  Like others here have said it will depend on the cost.  I don't think he should be high on the priority list.  Hopefully interest is low enough that hed be a mid to late July and after signing after the Wolves kick the tires on whatever midlevel shooters may be available.
Well in LoL and Dota everyone have access to wards. Which means their abilities can be more flavorful and more interesting.   In other words, Lunara have built-in wards/wisp, which in turn means she have one (usually) damaging ability less in exchange for that.
Well, no shit because KZ's jungle was heavily behind early. What do you expect them to do 2vs3 agaist lvl 6 skarner while your jungler is lvl 4? It's a team game.
I had McCrimmon as a customer a month or two back and I mentioned to him that he needs to bring a pre-season game to Brandon. He says it's outside of his control.. but who are we kidding?!

I actually think Hungary is a potential winner (Of course I'm biased bc it's my favourite currently, but hear me out): Everything points to the fact that Hungary finished in a **really** good position (1-3) in their semi, they have a unique song in a niche genre, but still have a memorable and catchy chorus (Viszlat nyaaaaaar), they have a message everyone can kinda relate to ( it sucks, when your father dies) and the guys are really sympathetic in their own way.  Would I bet on it?  No.  Do I think they have a chance?  Absolutely.  And for Bulgaria, all the same points apply, bar the deep message. So they have a chamce as well.

I wouldn't mind wearing lawbringer gear with warden for example, then they dont need new models, just use old models and make them fit what's possible to fit. Imagine the chain armour from zerker on the nude chest of raider. That's still very different even though it still uses the same armour models. I just doubt we're getting new armour ever , really.
to be honest, it’s not a bad idea to tank a bit considering the super draft that we have coming up

I haven't branded them C2DE and I'm not annoyed they don't vote the way I want.   DE's are 'Semi-skilled & unskilled manual occupations, Unemployed and lowest grade occupations'.

They are probably not well up on what a customs union is, or how to best fund a health care system. They respond well to simple slogans and jingoism.   That is, of course, a generalisation, but it's one that's supported by many right wing politicians.   >Right-wingers are less intelligent than left wingers, says study.

Dude.  The whole problem is hiding from vulnerability in your life.  It will be heard.  It’s crying for visibility and a dot-connect to the emotional truth about your “porn family” system.

Floorboards are typically 20ish mm. Which is slightly less than 1 inch. There is, however, 3-500mm of structure between floors. So those screws are at least 300mm long.

The fact of the matter is that many big clubs do not play formations with LMs and RMs. Some notable exceptions are Tottenham, Inter, M'gladbach, Leverkeusen and Hoffenheim. That is why a lot of the best LMs and RMs in FM come from these clubs. Others are just position changes, which isn't really possible in TOTS.

For low budget options I'd suggest uniqlo and h&m. To bring in her look start with a few casual tops esp stripes , in tshirt or 3/4 length, you can do linen (uniqlo) if 3/4 length for Florida , 1-2 floral mini dresses or rompers (h&m), a light utility jacket (h&m), and an interesting print (either store) , and a cute pair of shorts. The very very first couple items could be swapping your band t for a striped tshirt that you half tuck into your existing jeans , then a utility jacket that you swap your hoodie for.

There's actually an Orcish Greatbow in Pathfinder that you seem to be reflecting, intentionally or not, just as a side note.  To that end, it's an interesting take. You can just define the Orcish Greatbow as a martial ranged weapon to save most of the Requirements text. On that note, generally it's prudent to set odd values for stat requirements on items (see heavy armor requirements) to help give them some relative value.  Frankly, I'd cut the extra damage bonus and the save-on-hit part of the melee attack option for the bow. With the 15 or 17 Str requirement, a single weapon being able to outdamage and outrange (I'd add some to that for good measure) the longbow AND having it also be a competent melee weapon as well is already a massive boon. I might just let it be treatable as a quarterstaff as a melee weapon as well. The knockdown effect I feel makes perfect sense as a mastery feat bonus, being able to commit a bonus action perhaps to a 'super shot' that gives the ranged strike a DC (8+proficiency+Str mod) knockback effect on the next attack if it hits sounds pretty hot.  My hot take:  **Orcish Greatbow**   *Martial Ranged Weapon*  Cost: 75 gp   Damage: 1d12 piercing   Weight: 8 lb.   Keywords: Ammunition (range 180/720), heavy, two-handed special*  Special: The greatbow can be wielded as martial melee weapon dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Melee and ranged attacks made with this weapon suffer disadvantage unless the wielder have a Strength score of 17 or greater.
A few things for M. Raven.  d/f+1 being i13 would be nice or at least always i14. I’d like it if she had a mid that hit grounded that wasn’t b3 or uf3 If Heihachi had anything I want him to have he’d be too top tier
There is something of a problem here: a big ol' backstory is great.. But it sounds like the players intended to keep it from the DM, which is an issue. It's the DM's job to incorporate the players and their histories into the world of the game, and they can't do anything if the players literally aren't letting the DM see the backstory.   A _little_ give and take is reasonable to ask for: it's collaborative storytelling, after all. The DM is bending for the odd trio of bloodhunters all existing in the pre-established 'up to it's neck in red tape' lawful city, and is trying to find a way to make the events they've outlined work out within the setting. The trio seem willing to give absolutely no slack, and are again hiding their backstory... So I guess they can bring it up whenever they damn well please to interrupt the story later? It makes no sense.
You can already do this with chocolatey on Windows and first party support is in beta.
Wow. He said he talked to Q, and Q is no longer Q, so trust him and not Q. Jeesh.
Pugs are also mutant creatures with more health problems than weight. Pugs may try to murder less, but pit bulls can at least take care of themselves
Because they’re supposedly the party of “family values”...unless you try to apply those values to their own families.
Your hair reminds me of Thorgy Thor!
Grabity is a really great one! Thank you so much.
I’d be for it, but not the data download that comes along with it.
On the bright side, at least it’ll end while it’s still good and not turn into garbage like other shows have
Higher scores are always better than lower scores, but what also matters is how you score relative to the other people who took the test (which you won’t know).
I started with 4 and went back to 3, then played Primal. I’d say start with 3/4, then play the other and primal last.
Buy cheap maiming strikes from panic sellers, people eventually realize the rework is SOON™ and maiming strike is still useful in the mean time.  Price goes back up, GROFIT.

I enjoyed their discussion about match-ups and strength of teams. It was cool for two players in the same position from different teams to talk like that.

I've been having people tell me that imgur severely compressed the image and when they downloaded it, it looked distorted or low res.

Ughh phillies out homie.
I'm with you, man. Like you said, those final minutes when theres only 10 people is some serious, heart-pounding shit. But nothing will match the first time I went into customs accidentally at night, couldn't see a fucking thing, and could hear dudes ringing off silenced weapons everywhere. Never in my life have I been that stressed from a video game before haha
I brought in a camelbak Lobo which is pretty big and it was allowed in.  The one linked will be allowed in.
I’m not sure, but it seems like a lot of people including me want legend of Zelda. The moment that breath of the wild link comes out and/or Summer breath of the wild (just his blue undergarments) Link comes out, I will be tempted to break F2P. Right now I think they are still setting the grounds for more representation with their older games in the series. Once FE has more representation, I believe they would consider a crossover. They are on a good stride though I believe considering all the genealogy reps coming, less focused 3DS seasonals which I don’t mind to clarify, I love the 3DS characters as well as the old school ones. I have Lyn emblem and Lucina emblem complete
fuck it, yahoo screens.  you got me a 6th season of community.  give me the 99!
I'd recommend WD Blue 1tb over Seagate.     You should get Cx 550 over Cx 450.    Also, you can go for a cheaper b350 mobo and get a 250gb ssd.

I heard alot of mixed reviews about Xenoblabe is it any good?
The actor that played Joffrey Baratheon seems like such a nice guy in interviews, and even though I know it's wrong, my blood still boils a bit when I see a picture of him. He's such a convincing actor.
Joaqin Phoenix and Mel Gibson in Signs look like they could be brothers IRL

Latency is great PvP party's are now the same as pve parrys on contact instead of as they start swinging. I even had a laggy red phantom invade and they parry i got on him was on contact.   Armour looks fine i even notice that they have light reflection now the long sword too reflected light
Go ahead young lad, for any position that needs depth, first you must always look towards the academy before looking at the market.   I'd love to be able to become one of these Ajax sort of teams that just constantly produces class players, in recent years we've produced TAA, Wilson, Woodburn, Ward, Sterling, Suso, Shelvey, Coady and Ojo. (To an extent, not all are completely ours) I can't remember a better batch before that since Gerrard came through
Who even goes to Soycucks anymore?
Every. Single. Time. But thats because I wore studded jeans as a teenager (thirteen? Idk) . I think I ended up on a list :/ it persisted for like 10 years and stopped like....2 years ago? I fly ofteb enough that it was a  huge pain

“Over the top”... is that the phrase one uses when your competition is able to do more and still cost less?  “Ooh they’re just too much, it’s too much of a good thing. You should want to pay more and get less...”
A “Hitler rapist”? Do you mean a Hitler sympathizer?
You said it yourself, it's because the pick is unconventional. They assume because it isn't "meta" or something like "OMG U CNAT JUNGLE WIHT A WARRIOR WHAT ARE YOU INSANE" Still, I really like playing Nox in Support, Bakasura in ADC, and Tyr in Jungle sometimes.  I remember once I picked Bakasura ADC with a Ymir Support. Ymir BM'd the fuck out of me until I went 7-1 and they surrendered at 10.
He can because he’s not worried about what “the man” is going to say about his tweets. He is “the man”.
It can be tough to break the habit of eating very little, since it sometimes feels like it’s a slippery slope to gaining all the weight back. I’m definitely working on it, though :)
When you’re hitting the 8th rep at RPE 7-8. Which means you knew you could do 2-3 more reps but stopped at rep 8.   Over time you just get an intuitive understanding of when to go up in weight but when starting off this is a good way.
That I don't mind, wouldn't get it on my ass though 🤔
I’d love Ippei to draw Gerik, Kumiko Suekane to do Maribelle, and maybe HACCAN to do Reina.  Oh, and Tobi should do Kliff.

You're gonna have to marathon Absorbing Man, haha ;D  I hope they add a season 5 Coulson, with new moves from his bionic hand. How cool would that be!
As a father, my guess is he and Mrs. Trill are still on parental leave and haven’t yet had to get back into the work routine.  That first couple of weeks is delirious and happy and you miss a crazy amount of sleep. Even considering that, you still feel great because 1. new baby, and 2. not going to work is really fucking relaxing, it turns out.

Oh my gosh, the pizza story. I can relate so hard. Besides the intrusive thoughts I get, my OCD presents itself in germaphobe type ways...I'm so messy because I literally can't pick things up because they're dirty, and stuff like that. The thought of everyone touching pizza disgusts me. Or when someone blows out candles on a birthday cake I just imagine saliva all over and I can't eat it.
Exactly! That’s just what I was telling one of my friends today. I’m pretty well into quitting save for the occasional one every few weeks or so, and I don’t miss it, I actually think I don’t even like them anymore.  But the action of it and the camaraderie of hanging out with other smokers, bumming cigs around and sharing lighters, talking shit or whatever outside the building. Even just sitting somewhere on your own is so nice. That’s what I miss. Because you can technically still hang in the circle but it’s just not the same. That’s been the hard part.

Eternal Envy didn't have a teleport scroll in game around 3-4 years back. Arteezy boots of traveled in with lycan to go throne and EE had aegis and tried to die to fountain but was too tanky took too long. If he could die instantly and then aegis respawn and die instantly it would've been good for his team.  But yeah it only happens to me about once every 6-8 months so it's pretty low chances.
I doubt this would be the case because if so then there either wouldn't be the angel death effect or having it as a fakeout would be pointless because micheal would know but the group wouldn't and then it would leave him to be indefinitely tortured in that world's heaven.

Wow you people are saying that the 4 police officers that were searching a trailer with a max of 4 rooms and I think it was actually 3 but 4 trained LE that have probably done hundreds of searches couldn’t find the key in 2.5 hour in that little closet of a bedroom that’s laughable.
Ohh oops, Ghostneko is my actual IGN, sorry😅
I’m skeptical too. It’s good those prisoners got released, but I’m not sure why they would give up their nuke and missile tech after their recent progress. They know the US can’t launch a preemptive strike.

Thanks.  I thought that was the case.  I was outside the other day working on my car and I noticed some pilots like to approach looooooowwwww over my place so the Spark stays grounded here at home.
Yes. "Mongolen" can mean both.
In terms of corporations, ownership doesn't always mean a top-down authoritative rule.  At the end of the day, it comes down to it.  But, you know, decisions can be reviewed and adjusted.  Agents of Shield probably has had it's viewership decline a lot from when it first began.  If it was any other show, it may have been canceled already.  But, it might pick-up additional revenue in sales, cross-overs with the new movies coming out (Shield seems to be a part of Captain Marvel and therefore Avengers part 4 so there's a lot of possibility in cross-promotion).
I love it when Nenshi gets upset!
My thought is that the mentioned part gets lifted and somehow disengages the hammer from the wheel. when that part drops the hammer re-engages with the wheel.    I believe that's the general function of a cam. This is going off the memory of a "Connections" documentary by James Burke that I watched over 10yrs ago.  It's a really good documentary series. I highly recommend it.
>Republican  Everyone, this is how you know that foreigners from shithole countries are brigading your national subreddit.
Since your mind reflects your upbringing, as in the way you learned to look at the world, all of your actions can be predetermined. All the things that have ever happened to you are reflected in your person. Therefore, if someone knew everything, theyd be able to predetermine everything too. All the actions you take are simply the way the world shaped you. Also, if you think your willpower or something makes you strong, think what in your life gave you that willpower.  This has been the mildly emo mind of the eighth grader.

Why would you want to multitask like that to begin with?  In any ship that's optimized for a role other than combat, it's pretty trivial to get wherever you need to in the bubble to turn in whatever data/missions you need before swapping to your combat ship. Why would you want to leave those credits unclaimed anyway, when they could be used to upgrade your ship or cover rebuy?  And besides, leaving these things player-bound let's you do things like earn money in a large ship and then turn it in to a small outpost in a medium/small ship. The current CG is a great example of that use case - the CG station only accepts medium/small ships. I'm going to be doing all my bounty hunting in my coat Corvette, then swap to my DbX to turn in my claims for the CG.
I think I like this off\-shoot of the onion more than PatriotHole.
That should have happened and it didn’t, and that is part of why it’s a news. AEB is quite a marble of modern technology, I think pioneered by Subaru, but nowadays it’s a bolt on package. It should just work once correctly tuned to a model before mass production begins. Don’t even need OTA.

Except he’s not technically a rapist. He was convicted of sexual assault, not rape which is why it was a much lighter sentence.  I don’t agree with that, but that is the way the law was written, which is why the judge handed out the sentencing he did. He was following the law.

>I paid for ad-free, is a dollar really so much?  Not alone, but if I paid a dollar for every half decent mobs game I saw I’d have spent a lot of money, so I try not to buy anything at all. There’s enough free games out there anyway.   >Aside from that, there is no need at all to pay more unless you want to. It isn't designed as a game you can blast though to lvl 50 supercarriers in one day, it's designed as a game you have a fiddle with and make a bit of progress with and then put down again each day, or maybe several times a day. Like many, many smartphone games, it is incremental progression over a timescale of weeks or months, it's not a $60 PC game you play nonstop for 20 hours then forget.  I’m not complaining about the leveling. I didn’t even mention it. The problems are the abundance of ads and really long repair times, both of which can only be fixed with real money.

The Edge's has got many more unique sounds out of his guitar. Seeing as Coldplay have 7 studio albums, U2's 7th was 'Achtung Baby'. The Edge had a distinct guitar style and had created many iconic guitar parts by then. Jonny Buckland wouldn't be on a list anywhere near the Edge. He'd struggle into the 00s to be honest, most innovative guitarist (IMO) of past 20 years is Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.   Coldplay started a lot later. They've made 7 albums and they're all about 21 or so. U2 were about 30/31 by the time of 'Achtung Baby'.   There has/ws been PLENTY of hatred of U2 and I'd agree Coldlay as well. What they do, they do very well, and they know their audience.   Again, please make a judgment when you''ve heard the full album. i'm expecting or making you like it, just don't judge ikt til you've heard all of it.   And apologies if I sounded petty earlier.

When I signed up for Chase they had an overdraft policy where instead of being overdrafted, the money would be taken out of a Chase credit card they issued you. I signed up for it and was denied for the card, no big deal. Well one month I was strapped and an emergency vehicle repair came up for about $300. With all my money in and out balanced I had about $250. So I didn’t use my bank account anymore that week and was okay with overdrafting $50 and paying the $35 fee. Well they decided to have that big payment come out first and have all my little purchases from the last week come out after. I ended up having 26 overdraft charges. I was pissed. I paid it off, got my account to $0, then closed it. Well, a couple weeks go by and I get a bill for over $700. Even though I was denied for the credit card, I still got one and they were double dipping overdraft charges. I could not get customer service to understand what was going on. This was back in 2007 so the debt is long gone now, but I will forever hate Chase.
then what the fuck are you even doing on the subreddit hahahaha why stick around just to talk shit i just can’t seem to figure it out.
The sidebar at r/skincareaddiction (no underscore) and r/Asianbeauty has great resources, might want to start there. For AHA/BHA, I currently use Pixi Glow tonic 1-2 times per week as a toner, then also use The Ordinary AHA/bha peel once every 10 days. I tend to have dry skin though, so you might be able to use them more. Stridex pads are also popular and accessible, but I don’t have any experience personally!  If you start using acids, be sure you use sunscreen bc it’ll make you way more photosensitive too!

First, your girlfriend is a jerk for sticking you with this.   Second, make an egg casserole of some type. It is cheap, and depending on the mix-ins, can be gluten-free and without shellfish. In my experience, an egg casserole with a bunch of omelet toppings mixed in works well. Make a few pans, chill then in the fridge overnight, and then bake them in the oven morning-of.   Fruit salad and a cheese/cracker plate should cover the rest. Do flavored water for a drink, or ask guests to bring their own drinks. Stores like TJ Maxx have large water dispensers for about twenty-ish dollars. Chop up some lemon/lime/fruit and throw in with some ice the morning of the brunch.   Good luck!
I just saw the most recent ranks xD T5 cutoff is about 15-16k, and my standard method for calculating safety is take the 1800-1900hrs cutoff, and add 10k for T5 xD hasn't failed yet.   looks like this was a slow event, especially when compared to the previous few. I'm likely to end at around 32-33k

You’ve lost me.   A big part of Slytherin is being Ambitious and Self-Serving, which aren’t bad qualities, they just happen to be in the worst people. Harry has proved that he would risk his own life for others.   I truly don’t understand what you mean by his “bloodline” should put him in Slytherin. If you’re talking about blood purity, then you forget that he was a half-blood because Blood purists don’t recognize muggle-borns to be true wizards. If you mean his family on his father’s side, then I’m truly lost. I believe every Potter was Gryffindor, or I’m just taking Sirius’ story and extrapolating it to James’.
Owntracks has almost zero extra drain since you can control when it reports.. I have mine set to refresh every 7 minutes and I personally can get almost 36-40 hours out of my phone (Moto G4 Play).. Mind you i monitor 4 different devices. During the day they tell me where everyone is, when everyone has left school/work and when everyone has come home. I could add a whole lot more to this as an automation but it works for me so why, right?  Again with the question of battery drain, it's a simple MQTT request that just send back telemetry data. It's not a constant 100 times a sec update. It's simple a request that gets answered. You can adjust your HA to do more or less but that's a personal choice. 7 Minutes works well for me as most people are home within that 7 minute arrival or shortly after letting me know that they are home.  The nice things with owntracks and MQTT you can fine tune your HA instance to do a lot while people are away. You don't need to know where they are just that they aren't where you think they are when they aren't. Being away you can turn lights on/off or even adjust thermostat.   I hope that makes sense. It's late as all get out and I'm barely awake as i'm typing.
It's the same in the USA, we just don't use the term "zebra crossing".    It's a hilarious term to me honestly.  And it would sound weird to you if I said it, since we pronounce it "zee-brah" and not "zeb-ruh"
No prob, I know the dude who made it. Considering the ENBs for FNV, it's probably the neatest in a technical sense, I don't think any other ENB uses LUTs, and especially not like that.

No point to leaving the solar system really.   Unless we have generational ships, and every legitimate simulation on those things basically guarantees a mutiny within 3 generations. Plus I have no idea how you'd build a machine that could be self sufficient for 500-600 years...   No, we're stuck here.   Good news is that if we take the denser parts of the Oort cloud into account, there's assloads of volatiles and ferrites for habitat building.   I think the first actually successful off-planet habitats will be people fleeing this shitshow of a world geopolitcal stage.

People are really unperceptive in general. I've got a DDD chest and my binder gets me basically flat, but most people didn't notice when I started binding even though I didn't bother to hide it at all. I've literally showed cis people my binder before and they just assumed it was an undershirt. Even when I'm binding "out and proud" in just a binder and no shirt, nobody ever questions it or gives me any shit.

For Shameless, the actress who plays Fiona demanded to be paid as much as the actor who plays Frank, and the studios agreed because the truth is that she is worth way more than he is to the show. It made sense that he was paid more, he's a very well established older actor and she was young and unknown. But I wouldn't watch the show without Fiona, to me she is the show. Also I kind of wish the writers had the balls to kill off Frank already because he's just annoying at this point and it doesn't make sense for him to still be alive. She has much much more screentime than he does. She's almost the main character, and he's almost just a comic relief character. And yet they pay him more.  She was more important to show but they kept paying her less because that's what they had been doing and they had no reason to change things until she said she would quit unless she was given equal pay.   They're not paying people what they're worth, they're paying the minimum they can, and female actresses can typically be paid less. I believe that's the kind of thing Cumberbatch is trying to change.
Same for me. The classes that have us switching so often end up with low splat points and calorie levels for me but I’m a sweaty mess so I know something good happened
**... and his name is Tyler!** We traveled to the summit of Mt. Silver today to face the famed Trainer Red. After grinding for an amount of time that seemed like it was way too long, I decided to go for broke. I felt fairly confident that he wouldn't completely eviscerate me if everybody was at Level 55, so I went for it. Here's how it all went down:He led off with his Level 81 Pikachu. Its high level makes you think that it's a threat, but Ursula quickly took it down with a single Earthquake. Next up, Espeon. To counter, I sent out Esther. With a level advantage of 18, his Level 73 Espeon was frightening, but Esther was able to knock it out with three hits of Shadow Ball. Next was Snorlax. At Level 75, this is as tough a Pokemon as you'll see in almost any game in the series, especially for an underleveled party. I led with Maurice to slap a Thunder Wave on the sleeping giant, and then swapped out to Ursula \(Ursula held the Focus Band, to prevent OHKO critical hits with Body Slam\). At this point I needed to heal stall, thankfully only two turns, waiting for a turn of paralysis. On the next turn, Ursula came up clutch yet again for the team, landing a Dynamic Punch on the first try! The hit brought the Snorlax down to about 55&#37; health, but it also confused him! On the next two turns, Snorlax hurt itself both turns while Ursula tried and failed to land another Dynamic Punch. On the third turn, Ursula landed an Earthquake which finally slayed the Snorlax. Next up, Venusaur was out. It took Krakatoa three hits with Fire Punch, and he took a massive hit from a Solarbeam, but he was able to take out the Venusaur with little trouble. Blastoise was next, and was the recipient of two quick Thunder Punches, but not before setting up the win for my team! Red's short\-sighted use of Rain Dance allowed Captain Magma to wrap up the win with a Rain Dance\-boosted Surf OHKO on his Charizard. Run complete, and with no losses in the final battle!I really enjoyed this run, and I had an incredible team throughout. I'm going to be starting the next in the series soon \(possibly this weekend\) with a Ruby Regionlocke. Same rules apply; I can only use Pokemon native to the Hoenn region for this run \(which shouldn't be as difficult as Gold was, I had very few opportunities for encounters after Ecruteak City\). I love all of the Gen 3 starters and haven't decided which to choose yet; I'll probably just go by trainer ID if I can't decide. Keep an eye out for the start of that next! Thanks for reading!
It’s misspelled in the title — it’s *brake* checking and it’s an asshole, road-ragey type move where people tap or slam their brakes when they are already close in front of someone, to try to force them to slow down and to scare them. This isn’t actually a brake check in this gif, though. Just a bad title.

It's what makes her such a good push-support with DDs.  Zao can follow close to friendly DDs and when enemy DDs are spotted, her effective engagement range is massive enough that she can often kill fleeing or distant DDs well beyond the comfort range of other cruisers.  Assuming a target that flees from full health immediately versus a solo cruiser, lethal range against a DM is about 8km, less for Mino, 9 for HIV, 10-12ish vs Moskva, and around 15 vs Hindi/Zao, due to gun characteristics against fleeing targets.    Of those last two, Zao is much more likely to sneak up close enough to where the DD will be completely unable to escape, where Hindi is likely to be spotted on approach.  Against a spotted DD (via your own DDs), if the enemy DD is heading toward a Zao and the Zao gets spotted at the edge of her concealment, it's already too late:  You'll eat two 6k salvos before you've even turned around, and without cover or assistance long dead before her guns have trouble hitting you.

You’re using a Western baseline to judge his quality of life and standard of living.   Reminds me of Niue. Fucking Brits went there and built everyone finder block house in an effort to lift them out of poverty. They rip the doors off most and used the shacks to stack stuff in.    They didn’t need the houses and they have plenty of food. The people were much happier before your kind arrived and they’d survive (and live much less complicated lives) and be plenty happy if you or any other tourists never return.     Tourism and crappy material goods are important to you. Do not try afix your ideals to other people.

\>  a\) cuttlesnek most likely talks about Iran abiding the deal and stopping to pursue their nuclear program   Technically no, as the documents shown by Bibi proved that Iran lied about their program in the first place. Iran said they never had program, which is most evidently wrong.

Because you knew the rules and chose  to ignore them? If I go to Germany I can't claim to speak on behalf of my government; likewise Iran made a \*verbal\* agreement with Obama and never signed anything. You were warned when the Republicans wrote that letter and chose to ignore it due to greed.

I pretty much use exclusively grenadier weapons because of this. They’re hard to use so I don’t expect to have an incredible k/d, and so I don’t mind when I’m not doing well, but every single kill I do get just feels so good.   Once you learn the movement mechanics as well it eats so much better, especially once you learn to use the grappling hook to it’s full potential with slingshotting and such.
You know what is scarier? The police don't even need a complete DNA sample to convict you. Incomplete and mixed DNA have been used to convict people for years.   In forensics, they would test for 13 loci pairs (locations of your alleles). Many crime scene samples are incomplete, so you wont know all 13 pairs. (By the way, there are about 20,000 in the human genome). I remember a case where a crime scene sample only had 5.5 loci pairs, and they matched it to a guy and convicted him.  Back in 2000, someone stumbled upon a two people who had a match of 9 out of 13 loci, which was thought to be incredibly rare. One guy was black, one was white, which made it even rarer. After a lawyer got wind of this, they got a judge to order how many matches in that database (I believe it was Arizona, and the database had 65,000 DNA samples from convicts). There were nearly **150** people in the database who had a match between 9 and 12 out of 13 loci. It is postulated that the 11 and 12 matches are brothers (since they are way more likely to share DNA).  That was 18 years ago. More and more it was found that DNA statistics (1 in a quadrillion chance it is someone else's DNA!) was *way* off. Nobody had thought about populations in regional areas having similar DNA to each other, families having similar DNA, *and* the birthday problem.   So last year the FBI started using 20 loci pairs for testing DNA, because the old 13 just weren't as convincing as before. But juries still convict people with less than 13 loci match when crime scene samples are incomplete, because they see DNA as infallible.   It would be like if a criminal left their credit card at a crime scene, and the cops looked at just the last 4 digits. But let's say 2 of those digits were unreadable. The cops would then look for 4x5x in their database, and your unlucky ass happens to have the last four digits of 4356, and they charge you. The jury would hear "we found his credit card at the crime scene", and you'd be on death row.  Your family is also likely to have a closer match to you. So two brothers could have close enough DNA that they'd look like 100% match on paper, because only a sliver of DNA is tested, and brothers (and fathers) share the same Y chromosome.

There’s just too much. They get fed this stuff 24/7 and it really appealed to the racists in this country, we just underestimated the sheer number of them still living among us.     These people had an extreme hatred of Obama, either because he was black or because he was a Democrat. Both have been vilified in the right wing media so much that we are their enemy, not fellow citizens looking for a common goal.     There was such a backlash that I feel they are trying to make us pay for them having to “put up with Obama for 8 years”, as my SIL stated.     Still not sure what they had to put up with, but here we are. Revenge voting is absolutely a thing. Mix that with apathy and you have the perfect store to squeak in a win.     We tried to warn people, but here we are.

You mean the ones with physical buttons or the newer ones with virtually no bezel?  For the former, if you disable the hardware buttons and use an on-screen nav bar they should be easier to handle.    For the latter, I guess you could look into getting single hand mode to move the shrunken screen up a bit, to help you reach the nav bar.   It might require significant work to implement and be rejected as a feature in LOS, though.

Agreed. I also hope they take this into account when filming next season in regards to some of the challenges. There have been a few challenges that seemed short in comparison to the entire episode and without much workroom drama or banter, it kind of seemed like they were trying to fill it. Lol. But that hasn’t really happened as much. The one that pops in my mind the most was the Bossy Rossy episode. Like that challenge could’ve been a little longer, cause there were a few workroom moments that kinda drug on.

Nerubian Eggs can be buffed by Blessing of Kings, Blessing of Might, Fungalmancer, Keeper of Uldaman, and Tarim. Then you can use it to attack other minions or hit face. If your opponent kills it, it becomes a 4/4. It is primarily used as a counter to AoE effects. And it can be summoned by Call to Arms, which is why it is used in Paladin decks.

Touch uses a capacitive layer below the glass to detect touches (basically it's a grid of very thin wires with minimal electricity flowing through, and your finger disrupts this field, which is picked up and handled as a touch).  The S-Pen uses a separate grid for this, using radio waves instead, and it also disables the capacitive grid.   Your issue is related to the capacitive grid, hence why it only happens when you touch the screen. It's most likely hardware fault, so I'd suggest taking it into the closest Samsung service point.

One more season to complete the transition it seems. May be good to have Gnabry play a season under Robbery's guidance. Also, it means we'll likely see Ribery and Robben retire in a Bayern kit. Rafinha has stepped up in a big way, and looks to be in similar form to the Pep years where he basically acted as a Lahm clone when needed.  If it weren't for the fear of their extensions causing a prolonging of winger purchases, every Bayern fan would love this news. Arguably two of the hungriest and most hard working players we have.
IM GOING RONKERS
That's not sub-modding, I can't quite put it, but that would just be your opinion, not anything else.
This proves that even if Folty is pitching relatively well, he's bad by the third time through...

You can do this, but I'd recommend you instead get a nice envelope-based budgeting software like YNAB.
Yep, totally. Also boosterpacks for every TCG. And don't forget about Kinder eggs. Why isn't anyone complaining about them?
>people have been speculating that he might not be able to fully erase dr manhattan from existence. how does that work exactly? if you erase them from existance and then bring them back (like imagine theyre gonna do) did they really erase them from existance? like they have to somewherein order for them to return, meaning they didnt really got erased. dr M can probably reverse the erasing.   Who knows? They haven't shown how it works in the MCU yet, so all we can really do at this point is speculate. I haven't read the comics and to be honest I'd rather not know how it happens, in case the MCU story follows the comic one and spoils it for me.  Just going off my own knowledge, I would venture to guess that Thanos with all the stones could erase Dr. Manhattan completely, there's not really any evidence to suggest otherwise. A lot of speculation comes from wondering if he could erase Celestials. In the MCU, we only know of two Celestials that have existed, those being Eson the Searcher and Ego. Given that Star-Lord is Ego's son, he inherited the Celestial gene, and *was* erased, I think the evidence points more towards the idea that he can erase a Celestial. That's weak evidence, but it's more than nothing, and nothing so far has said that he can't.
Ok deadpool. (He also said that)
IMO all the Geordie shore girls totally ruined their faces. Both Chloe and Charlotte got botched nose jobs that made them look 10x worse, they have miss piggy noses that don’t match their face. It’s sad to watch young girls ruin themselves like this.
Atheist = A-Theist = "Without god". It means a lack of belief in god, not an assertion that there is no god. Big difference.
Fuckin a. I banged a chick at the tail end of hers. My dick and thighs were a shade of red. Didn’t gross me out - it’s life. But still...  not super awesome, you know?

oh shit, messed up the title. i was kinda excited lmao, my bad.  but im guessing this is a bug because there's no official announcement or such.
Can’t say anything about the micro, but the full size carbine is the most fun gun I’ve ever shot (that’s not FA at least). Idk why, it’s just a blast, and it will run anything you put in it. It’s also super accurate at 100 yards with open sights, much more than a 9mm has any right to be. However I’m a bit biased when it comes to CZs haha.
So your post is a bit difficult to understand, but from what I gather, this woman has no loyalty to the boyfriend she's had for four years and you nor Guy A are the first two men she's fooled around with during that time. Don't let this woman be your first serious relationshio, dude, it could seriously mess you up down the road when she inevitably cheats. Ask yourself this; would you be comfortable with your girlfriend having another guy sleep on her bed and fooling around while you're away? Fuck no.
I prefer post-aluminum foil being crumpled up
A big part of BLW is not giving them purées, because it doesn’t get them used to chewing and self regulating bit size.  I’m not sure if you are giving her purées, but you mention all non puréed foods. It is important that you give her things that she can learn to bite and chew. Has she mastered a pincher grasp? We started doing a lot of finger foods around that time. I just sort of adopted the approach that the same food I was feeding everyone else in small pieces is finger food. There is a learning curve and she still tries to shove too much in her mouth. Packaged snacks seem to inspire this shoving behavior in my kiddo. Try offering streamed and fresh veggies cut into finger sized sticks.   I’m sure you already know this, but food before one is just for fun, and their main source of nutrition should be breast milk or formula. Make sure you know what to do in case of choking and what it looks like. The gagging will get better as they get more solid food experience.
She is a very poor healer if she can’t smack your team around. Distsnce yourself and she quite literally can’t do anything, now, I will say that some things were a bit overtuned (such as shield bash cooldown), but even with the adjustments she will still be a very strong hero and will still be meta. Those nerfs won’t weaken her at all I’m the way you complaining about though. Either learn to play around/with her, or don’t play at all. She’s here to stay.
You don’t want that sauce homie, trust me.
I think you’re right. This was as a back up as I don’t want to take any chances. I’ll also be on antimalarial tablets too.
I suspected as much, it’s still annoying that that is the default though! That is hilarious though, who wouldn’t. Actually never mind, some idiots do.

Good, that overpriced bitchmade has to stop.
Not necessarily essentials, but a kinky sampler pack toy bag...  * Safety Shears  * Sex and safer sex supplies (any toys you have and like, condoms, dental dams, lube...)  * Basic rope (a couple lengths of inexpensive, soft cotton rope is fine to start with)  * Velcro fabric cuffs (another restraining option)  * Eye mask/blindfold (blindfold the bottom for sensation play, but also takes some pressure off the new rope top when they're consulting the book on how that tie goes)  * Impact-y toys (Riding crop, ping pong paddle, wooden spoon, spatula, flogger type whips but they can get expensive, lots of these can also be used softly for more sensation and than impact, or mix it up to keep them on their toes)  * Sensation toys (Wartenberg wheel, riding crop, soft velvet gloves, feather ticklers, fleece gloves)  * Collar and leash (did you find a collar y'all liked? Get into that domination mindspace)  So this is thinking off the top of my head of some relatively cheap, easily accessible, more or less safe, and versitile toys for a beginner or novice player. And I'm more than open for additions and suggestions.

Is the pope a good Christian?  Does a bear shit in the woods?  Look man... look.  Okay.  The 5.3 has been mostly unchanged since 1999, only adding upgrades here and there like an aluminum block or cam phasers with the most recent addition of direct injection. It’s an evolution of the Chevy small block from way back in 1955.  The Chevy 5.3 is an incredible motor with a lifespan into the 300k+ on the newer trucks and around 250-275k on the older trucks like my 03.  The 5.3 has never let anyone down ever.  No one talks shit on the Chevy 5.3.  It had some minor problems with cam phasers as GM decided to experiment right around the time they declared bankruptcy and it leads to issues with shot lifters on some trucks in the 08-13 range but that’s it.  Very minor compared to every motor ever.  In all seriousness this is a super super sturdy engine with not bad numbers behind it.  It’s not a high end performance engine or even the performance option on these trucks and I’m not even sure it had ford and dodge beat for hp and torque most years but at the end of the day, it’s reliable as all hell and still puts out good numbers.  You absolutely cannot go wrong with a 5.3

I said it last week, I'll say it again. I SAW the writing on the "tea leaves" that THIS is a COUP by Gregg. This proves it.  Congrats 'GREGGheads' - you've done it now. This program has gone 9+ seasons under the guidance of Tim Heidecker and now we see the decline.   You've gone and done it, that I'm sure of.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine was cancelled yesterday :(   But.. sounds like other networks/streaming services may pick it up, I really hope so! It’s such a good show and Fox just had to cancel it.

another day where BT becomes WT again.  everyone knows if you call a cop on a black person for anything, no matter what, chances are that cop is going to murder them because thats what the statistics add up to.  a heated argument isnt a "WE NEED THE COPS" situation you fragile bootlicker. but since white people call the cops when the music is too loud or because a black person lingers for too long somewhere in public, not surprised to see MinstrelTheatreTwitter protecting their own.
I used to work at Just For Feet, before it went out of business. You’d be surprised how often this would happen. Typically we would just follow the smell to find what box the old shoes were in if we saw someone trying to walk out with new shoes on.
Did not pronauncing r if it isn't followed by a vowel evolve into pronouncing r, even if there isn't one, when the word is followed by a vowel? Eg.: "Ma's not here." vs "MaR ate earlier."

Yeah this. I get how this guy is thinking but forreal. It takes a lot more skill/talent and energy to create music than we think.

Urine shot from the urine of 20+ different men (pause)   There was a Carlo Rossi jug that had been sitting out for weeks in my fraternity's backyard. Naturally, it became the receptacle for every die-playing, drunk person's urine. I was shit faced and odds are'd a guy to drink from it. He 1 out of 2'd me, and I lost.
My MIL doesn't do this but oh lord my mother does. She spent quite a bit of time (YEARS!) buying cheap-ass jewelry from one of those dollar auction sites, convinced she could turn around and sell it for a profit. She was/is on a fixed income and spent a ridiculous amount of her living funds on this venture. When it turns out no one in their right mind wants the crap she decides to give it all to me! JOY! And when I don't wear it and rotate out the million pieces daily I get called ungrateful. She's even tried to give me the same piece more than once and then gotten mad when I say she's already given me it. Nope, you bought 30 of the same item, mother. I already have one. I don't need any more.   I do wear jewelry but I only wear specific pieces that are important. I have worn nearly every day since I turned 21 until my son became old enough to pull on it a necklace she got me. It was a special, one of a kind piece and I treasure it. I also wear every day my wedding band, which was my mother's and her mother's before her. I also wear nearly daily my moonstone earrings that my mother got me. They are one of a kind and I adore them. I'm not ungrateful. I just don't want to swap out the meaningful items I treasure for meaningless items that are being given to me so that they are out of her hair. I AM NOT A TRASH SERVICE!!   I think it's partly a generational and partly an age thing. My paternal grandmother often gave me "garbage" for gifts. One birthday she gifted me a plus size "grandma" shirt with a sewn on necklace still in the KMart bag with the receipt in it. It was on clearance for $4. I weighed about 130 pounds at the time, was freshly 19, and had an intense "boho" thing going on. Seriously, grandma. You bought it, it didn't fit, just return it or give it to Goodwill. Instead I had to feign gratitude.   I do know that I will inherit all of this when she passes on so sometimes I swallow my frustrations and just accept the gift. I don't think she's trying at all to make amends. I think her giving me things is her stockpiling ammunition for future disputes. "How can you be so ungrateful with all I give you?!" is a favorite attack. But I suppose I'd rather get it now and have less to clean when she dies.   Ugh. Just ugh.
That bitch is crazy. Sheesh. Thats a no from me, dawg.
Did you see it, cause this sounds like the sort of urban legend shite that goes through schools that typically happened 'the year before you got here'  Not saying you're lying, just that whoever told you probably was
As a property-owning cis male, I'm fine with this.
I find that people that take paintball seriously have deep mental issues. Went there one time in this forest area for a work function. The guy that organised it was really into paintball, had all the gear and an assault rifle styled gun, camo, wrap around glasses. It was so cringe.. anyway... game starts and it’s a long round cause it’s quite a big area.  This fucking psycho had literally dug out a little hole for him to lie in and cover himself with leaves and just camped there.   Let that sink in. There are people like this around.

We went to go pick up our old housemate who was a roof tiler, he was at a party but he left so drunk he’d passed out in a gutter at like 3 am, he was meant to leave for work around 6am.. We were called by his mate but we went and picked him up around 3, he then texted his boss  “I won’t be in tomorrow as I don’t know where I am”. His boss wasn’t happy, good laugh though.  He still kept his job.
"Talk back again. *Talk. Back. Again! I dare you, I double dare you, motherfucka. Talk back *one more* goddamn time!"
is that last rack 168hp? if you didn't make that, where the hell did you buy it?
When I was little I threw a clock out the window and my dad told me that because of that he was going to hit me with a stick. He had me find a stick, and if he wasn’t happy with it he would hit me with it and then make me get a new one. I spent about an hour looking for one that wasn’t too big or too small, and when I finally brought him one, he told me to turn around. He tapped me on the back and told me to never, ever, ever make him actually hit me. Never did anything stupid or malicious again.
“YOU CAN DO IT PARAS” *said in my best Rozina voice*
There's a couple of monsters and encounters that exist in this game to punish physical heavy teams, like the metal golems which you will find in neketaka. Those things took forever for me to whittle down with their high deflection and armor, perception buffs from priest didn't help that much as I still kept missing and bouncing off their insane armor with my dinky early game weapons. I didn't pick the lightning or fire seal on my priest either thinking I could brute force with buffed up melee power.  To add, magic users can easily destroy most ship boarding encounters so I really recommend having them in your party with some damage dealing aoe spells as well. This gives a ridiculous amount of loot and money for seemingly no effort at all. Just put shields on all your melee units in your party and benched party members so they can engage 2 units and not die quickly.
Or you could say “We played well, they played well, but they won and we lost because we were playing baseball and that’s baseball.”

>4) Tampa - 4306 S. Dale Mabry Hwy Tampa, FL 33611 (Scheduled to open May 18, 2018)  This is an example of the lack of communication we get from LHS. I saw the Tampa date in the the New Cannabis Ventures "interview" (not sure what to call it - paid promo maybe?) but in a previous press release they had said that Port St. Lucie would open early May and Tampa later in the month.  So what happened to Port St. Lucie?  Did it not get approved?  Is there a new date?  Maybe this is par for the course for most/all companies or general to weed stocks but as a neophyte investor I find the lack of communication troubling.  Maybe this is exacerbated by my annoyance in not having my emails to libertycec and IR at the main web page answered.  Why have a contact page to submit questions if you never answer?  At the very least they should be having ways for people (and here I'm thinking more about customers than investors but it woudl serve both) to sign up for email/text updates for dispensary locations
To be honest bro? I’m in the same boat as you. I got no clue
How are these tied to micro-transactions? I have too many mods and haven’t spent a dollar. Could you elaborate?

Correct; being able to survive 50 °C in storage is part of the DOT requirements for transport.  They can likely survive a bit higher, but I'd still be careful and as you suggested keep it in shade, or in a cooler, etc.  I have seen a photo posted from when someone left a canister on the parcel shelf of their car (i.e. under the back window) and it blew out the window when it ruptured.
Thanks, I’m trying to be a good mom even if I really don’t understand some of the things that make her, her. While we don’t have a great relationship (she is a teen after all) it is good and I hope to keep it up as she gets older. I definitely don’t want to be like my XMIL was. So at lest that gives me a starting place
Also, if you recalled during Rodman's trips, KJU was wanting diplomacy with the US and Obama wasn't going to be arsed to have it. In fact, during his Basketball Goodwill visits, he and the other players were excoriated by the left-wing press.
>  Whatever it is it’s clearly beyond the FCC’s power, but maybe not someone else’s?  You have to implement a system where there is some accountability. And that means that you have to secure the phone system so it cannot be spoofed with zero effort. So who can do this? The government can get the phone providers to do it, or the phone providers could do it on their own. And honestly its in their best interest to do so given a lot of people are going around them now, call with some other application etc.. And that pressure keeps building as people phone the phone itself is just a vector, why not just put my phone on silent so I am never bothered by them right?   If you secure the phone lines so phone numbers cannot be spoofed then you can actively kill the neighbor calling instantly. The robocalls themselves will take more work but now you have t a tool to ban companies that sell numbers to idiots and give phone services a way to recognize when one phone number is trying to call thousands of people per day and cut them off.
No idea, but they are Amazeballs. Love that tile!
I dunno where this ad is from, but in some places there are very few non-Caucasians. Like, less than 1%. In that case having a non-Caucasian doctor or even knowing anybody can be rather challenging.
Yeah, Your Overwatch (a OW news/guide channel) did a video recently and a few others are out there with suggestions about how to separate them because right now it's pretty true that McCree is just worse Hanzo in 90% of cases. Sure the flashbang is dope but it's too short (IMO all stun CC should be 1 sec) and everything else he does, Hanzo can do better. A few good ideas I've seen floating are to give him some sort of niche like Armor Piercing rounds, (where armor doesn't reduce damage, which fits in as a good counter to the current meta of shield wielding armor users), extend his range some, and maybe give him a genji treatment where Roll resets on kills, so you have much less reloading downtime and instances where you cannot follow up because you're out of ammo.
I mean, I space out and eat it on occasion, because I space out, and I Know its because i spaced out, and that on me, I'm never like WTF HELR Y NO HP!
That’s when you gotta take a quick break. Just step away for a sec. I think we’ve all been there.
Are you really that fucking stupid? It’s not “government regulations interfering in the free market”, it’s “ensuring companies that supply connectivity don’t get to filter content”.
This, with the lyrics on the new album, give me the impression that he isn’t acting anymore.
Yes plus they wouldn’t need to use the Shuttle for the second launch (Use the Ariane V or whatever launch vehicle is cheapest for your payload).   Also OP should account for downtime for getting the second telescope approved and built! I’m sure rebuilding was initially considered.
And ABC stands to own FOTB when and if the Disney/Fox deal goes through.
The question is, would the Blood Asp be too good below div 1? Only other solution would be to make an Anni-only division.
So what's the best way to farm Rashoumon? Since there are no free quests we can only get gourds from the raids, but we can't really use CEs to boost drops since we need to use the damage boosting CEs... which we can't get unless we farm enough gourds :/ The hands drop a bunch of gourds but ideally we need to ignore the hands and take out Ibaraki as quickly as we can.  It all seems contradictory so what's the best way to go about this?

That last sentence is gold considering I was asking for evidence. Wouldn't they prefer I accept a title at face value alone? You literally linked the same source, the source I read through, of email replies, and didn't find mentions of Quinn or Trump. All I ask is somebody prove the connection the title implies. If it's obvious this shouldn't be this hard. And why was my initial comment downvoted?
TLDR; The Chief Justice of all people, volated the law and people get mad at Duterte for just enforcing the law.  \---  The ouster of Sereno as Supreme Court Justice, many are fuming that this is an incorrect decision and democracy is now dead in the Philippines.       The mere fact that those 14 justices voted whether to oust Sereno or not is a clear indication that democracy is well-alive and thriving. The law works even if the result is not something you like. And democracy is definitely not dead just because of one ruling.       Sereno violated the law by not filing her SALNs. She did this not just one time but multiple times, 10 times to be exact. Few years ago, the late CJ Corona was removed from office by not including an item to his SALN which the fuming side accepted, celebrated and called it a moral victory. Sereno may have judged/ruled multiple cases in the Supreme Court on the basis of non-filing of SALN or failure to include items. So, why should the highest position in the judicial system be exempted on this rule?       The constitution said the SC Chief Justice MAYBE removed from office via impeachment. But it did not say CAN ONLY be removed via impeachment. Hence, other laws can be applied to her and in this case a Quo Warranto which is legal judicial proceedings done within the rules of court.       You may say those justices, 8 of them, who voted for her ouster are corruptible which make the decision doubtful, but what makes you think the other 6 are not?       These justices did vote and it is a democratic process. And it is not just one guy calling the shots. Even if all Filipinos voted to oust her or not, whatever the result, one side will still complain.       And let's change the parameters a bit, imagine it was Duterte and not Sereno on the center of this, would you call it a moral victory instead?       That is how the law works. It may not be always on your favour but atleast it is working.
Like every racist and sexist person does that.  Its just like drug addicts on that it tears away their friends and what their left with is.. whatever this is. Normal people dont asociate with people with extreme views. We tend to avoid people who think like this.
This. The first tournament was super hype to watch since Forsen was making some sick plays and actually managed to beat Shroud a couple of times, but with duos you could already tell what the outcome would be. I'm sure the devs are gonna learn from this and hopefully next time we'll get the good old solos.
You can totally private play against humans cross-play, no bots required. Tournaments, too.
> After a brief moment of no response, I turn my head and see that... his eyes are closed. Is... is this fucking guy napping? It's the middle of the morning. Unbelievable.  With the way you were writing this story I legit read "napping" as "fapping." I've been on Reddit too much today...
Got a tuck shop round the corner from my office that makes a typical burger like this. Got to have one every now and then for a bit of a flashback to grabbing one off the smoko truck back when I was working in a factory.
Why do you need to till the yard?  I am not be contrary.  I have just seen people do that thinking it will help when it really doesn't unless the thing is like a brick.  Our old neighbor did it and it made the situation actually worse for them.   If you are going to do turfgrass like fescue, then just try seeding it and keeping it wet for about 10 days.  if you are doing this over time, go ahead and grab a small bag and find a place that is okay and seed it just as a test plot.

I'm pretty sure if stuff breaks you have to use as close as possible to like for like parts. Although has Hartley never went into qualifying his car wouldn't be under parc fermé, so I guess they can use whatever, as long as it's in regulation.
Sameee. Since forever. Escapism is a quality option.
Indeed, Arcanine should have been among the very top defenders for that era, especially because so few people had high\-level Dragonites and Snorlaxes.  How well I remember scrounging for Growlithe candies during the Era of the Arcanine....
delineations, delayed postal votes, midweek election, poor management of voting stations, blackouts, extra recounts, delayed official results, delayed everything tbh.
Run! Most sprints are 4-5 miles, and some throw in a serious amount of climbing in that span. You're going to spend majority of the time trail running, so make sure that's a huge part of your training. Otherwise, the obstacles are grip strength oriented and when they're not you're doing some type of squat/deadlift type movement. So dead lifts, squats, dead hangs, pull ups, push ups, burpees, etc... will all work wonders.
not even the best player for Atlanta ;) but I do hope he and Miggy get TOTS cards
As expected, they went after the biggest complaints, and still didn't get it right.  tier 10 is now even stronger than before, and players will pay2win to seal club and stay there.   If they could find a match that is because nobody wants to play this pay2win trash.  vercingetorix was all barbarians really had.

when I was hungover and legit SO lacking sleep, squidwards suicide was the first one I read EVER then dead bart, then Mickey. I couldn't sleep at all that night and I was so fricken paranoid. took me a couple days to get straight.   I read all those again recently and they don't freak me out anymore.
I know you want to be with your husband and have him fall in love again but I think he’s already made up his mind. Getting two different apartments is not moving in the direction of getting back together. I think he’s either trying to ease you into leading a more independent life and/or afraid that you’ll make the divorce difficult. Does he have money or any other assets?  Unfortunately, I don’t think you should move out of the apartment. What you need to do is contact the best divorce attorney in your area.
*A little excitement escaped from inside of Avice and lit a small flame inside her eyes. Why, most of what this man was telling her seemed quite exciting indeed. Yet she was still trying to keep most of it down.*  "No no, don't worry about me. In fact, I believe I would like to ask you some questions about that. Not here, not now, but later. If we are to be on this train for almost a month there should be a good time to ask about it."  *And now onto the less-interesting-but-still-very-interesting subject.*  "A leader, you say? What role do you plan to play out in the creation of Heaven's Vale, then? A political leader, or a military one?"
She doesn’t need you to “be with her an help her through these moments”   She has her parents for that.   She needs you to be an adult, who gets over herself and the fact that it’s “killing her inside” and do what needs to be done to help her father get through the recovery period. That’s what she needs you for. Let go of what you want for yourself and let her parents be her parents.
I run a cluster of ps4 servers. It’s technically pvp settings but we play as if it’s pve. So we don’t randomly raid others. The pvp options benefit us all. We literally just started two days ago and have been looking for new players. We have 10 active users right now and it’s been a great 2 days.     I’ve ran servers for 6 months now and we always have fun. Just started fresh again with the center and ragnarok maps. You can transfer between them to tame Dino exclusives we personally set. We will add aberration in a few weeks. Now is a great time to join. Message me on here, add me on psn (ThursdayNit3) or even reply to me here with your psn.
I’ve been getting the same all day but mine’s a google account. Keeps prompting to let Google sign me in but then get this error:  ‘‘500. That’s an error.  There was an error. Please try again later. That’s all we know.’’  Most unhelpful error message ever!
I think you're conflating an acknowledged affair (like Vivienne's) with a one night stand. Vivienne's position as mistress is one which requires acknowledgment. Anora in DA:O talks about this a little bit. She basically states Cailan had women and that she knew about them, with the implication that she knew about them despite Cailan, not because of him. It's a grey area and probably differs from couple to couple, but as that applies to Bull, like, why should he care, especially if it's a one night stand? Noble business isn't his and this is a normal thing that happens in Thedas during this time period. I don't get the impression Bull's the sort to wreck some happy and committed relationships, mostly because he'd throw a wrench in his work as a spy.
It’s pretty easy to do, are you looking to start mining?
Ichiro is still playing at age 44 or whatever and isn't a superstar anymore but he used to be and is one of the greatest baseball players ever.  You would have heard of him 5-10 years ago if you know of Verlander today (assuming you started paying attention relatively recently)
Indian Hill is certainly nice in areas, but the IH Rangers enjoy busting interlopers.  Stop telling people about North Bend, please. Great bicycling, and even motorcycling, area too. And, everyone from the commercial 18 wheelers on down play nice.   Start at President Harrison's tomb, head west on Brower, wrap up past Shawnee Lookout Park, the turn right on Dugan Gap (nice uphill climb) which buts into Cliff. You can take Cliff back to Harrison's tomb and the jump down into Cleves, wrap back around to the west on Miamiview, and jump across the river on Lawrenceburg Rd.  If you have more time for an adventure. Start in Aurora, In, and head through Ohio, Switzerland and a little of Jefferson County until you hit the charming river town of Madison, IN. Not going to suggest a specific route other than pick back roads. Beautiful country.
I went for a jog this morning, seeing this makes me feel like I should go out for a jog again now.  but the thought of jogging again today makes me say @oww mah legs@ as well.
I don't have to depend on another human in 1v1.  Also I consistently win when outleveled. When I have equal or better levels, I win even more.  Too many players complain about card levels. I still win the vast majority of my guild matches where there are no card level advantages.
Just not interested in painted cars unless its octanes
Works for Mac, yes, but doesn't retain settings, no. Unable to automate that on Mac, sorry! You can use the RosterImport page to pull in rosters, that will go a little faster.
It won’t. The studio and director have a brief sense of what the world is, which is probably only that there are big ass monsters in it and you hunt them and that’s it. It’ll probably just be another shitty kaiju movie set in a distorted view of the MH universe.
I'll have to look up as to how Frontline works, but I'm happy that Caernarvon gets a recommendation. I grinded that when it was SD and the only guns were the 17pdr and the 20pdr A/B barrel, and it was frustrating to be a heavy that no one feared.
That's not entirely true, the app could translate touch into mouse input, or provide on-screen buttons that could be treated as controller.  I'm not saying that this would be comfortable, but it could be possible. And some games (turn based strategy games?) could be actually quite playable like that.
Yeah I have been noticing this, this year especially. There was a suicide and several sexual assaults happened but I've only seen 1 of the sexual assault stories in the news.  SJSU administration and housing has been keeping these incidents as hush hush as possible
repladies doesn't get the props they deserve, such a helpful and less toxic place
Same :^) Jungle Phase Rush Riven Inc next patch (Its shite btw)
No not at all. He’s a kid playing with something to prove. It’s almost like saying Kyrie was arrogant or LeBron was arrogant or John Wall was arrogant. Those guys come in with targets on their backs but Ben had one since he came over from Australia. He plays with an edge because he wants the opponents best game.  Saric? No why. Saric was balling when he moved into the inside and showed tremendous effort when he was on defense. The only issue was he just isn’t athletically gifted to constantly keep up on defense so that messes with the switches and scheme sometimes.  Brett made the right move by moving Covington to the bench because we needed someone to rotate in to become the main perimeter defender. The sad thing was Cov’s shot was still off.
Like their glasses, which had more social problems instead of technical. It’s just a reverse robocall.   What’s going to happen is once someone realizes they have been robocalled, they are either going to troll or hang up on it.

>Several sources with knowledge of TPUSA’s operations, who spoke to Mediaite on the condition of anonymity, said Svbervi was added to a “blacklist” of activists that the nonprofit’s leadership wanted to keep away from their Student Action Summit to avoid controversy. The list was later scrapped in an effort to boost attendance numbers, sources said.  When you know there are open fascists attending your conferences, but don't want to ban them because they're the only ones that show up.
I plan to get one from the shop tomorrow on Sat. But from what I've seen from Paradise's videos is the provided power (5v & ground) 2 pin to 3 pin cable is for the TE2. Since you are using a Panzer, just splice the 3pin end off and plug it in the screw terminals on the Brooks. I don't know how long the provide cable is and I don't have a Panzer anymore to test it. But if it is short, then you may to extend the cable or make your own.

So I just spent 25k lapis, 30 ticks and 12 4*+, and ended up with two troll Lila's. I know that takes an insane amount of luck but I cant help but feel depressed. For the past year I have been working on building my 2 Lando's and Fryevia and Sephiroth would have completed my DR chaining family. Now I Have 2 Lila's and I feel obligated to scrap my old team and start all over :(

Ok that’s cool.. can’t say I’d care about the 3D aspect.. thanks for the advice bro because the DS variations are confusing af lol.. might have to go look for a 2DS this weekend
Would like this. I’ve only gotten a few wins since I’m not good a building. Doesn’t mean I’m not getting better little by little.

For your last point, I'd say that the difference is that I use my computer every day, whether it's for games, browsing, class work, etc., whereas tabletop gaming is a casual hobby that I might do once a week/a few times a month. I feel like spending a minimum of $100\+ to even \*start out\* being involved in it is a bit silly. Which sucks, because I really wanna try it out. I'd love to have my own army of Lizardmen/Seraphon.
3 full laps, Got 4 Sephiroth, No Lila. Owell, that's 8 months of hoarding for you...  At least my Fryevia's going to be happy with a Kunshira and Roy TMR.  Also netted me an Elfreeda, my first TDH TMR ever!   Then got Queen, Prompto and Rem on Guaranteed. Kinda meh.  Got kinda unlucky, But I'm just glad for Fryevia actually.
He was still wincing in pain in the end scenes with Gamora.

I started playing D3 at release and quit not too long after that.  I started playing again about 6 months ago as a casual single player game and really enjoy it.  I can hop in, run a few rifts to try and grab new gear, I can pop on and join a group if I choose, I can start new characters, etc.  Basically, it’s just a pretty chill game that’s fun to play on and off.
It’s important to prove you don’t wear antiperspirant in some cultures.  I mean, who needs a speed stick when you are Superman anyway?
34DDD also here. 36DD and 38D are "sister sizes" as mentioned.  The band changes but the cup size doesn't. The  letter is based on the *difference* between the band size and the girth measured around the largest part of the cup.  Just making up numbers... let's say you measure 42" around at the widest part of your breasts. If your chest (band) measurement is 38" then the difference is 4" which makes you a D. If you're a 34 the difference is 8" which makes you a DDD.

Honestly I just farm 1 star dungeons till I have full inventory and sell it for flux \(among selling other stuff\) and buy hearts of darkness and mine with boomeranger. If I want to get tenticals or eyes then it be through tomes or breaking down shadow gear I farmed from dungeons.  But I'm also not a fan of how shadow towers work or how they have changed over time now.

I have schizoaffective bp. I am married. I don’t think you need to tell people upfront. Infact i have a masters in counseling and have studied relationships. If you want love and take ur meds and follow through with counseling I bet you will find it.
I’d go for HCl honestly. Taste like shit, but it’s cheaper than F.A.A. Just find the right dosages online that you want to start with.   For your first time, I’d recommend 750mg-1 gram. Empty stomach, don’t eat for an hour after.
Because if you really need to target someone you can. Having the option to (and I’m sure people use it) can’t be worse than not having it.   Additionally if you are on smaller devices (which is what joystick is best for) your thumbs can reach all the way to the cent of the screen, so you can cast abilities similar to how you would with touch, but keep the convince and joystick.  You can also manually target from the attack button which is a huge step and something I’d love to see in AOV.
I know it’s cliche, but I was on vacation in Rome, and we asked a couple of locals where to go, and we ended up in what looked like an old villa, service was horrible and t took almost an hour for our food to get there, but daaang, I could have eaten until I burst
agree that it’s very relevant now but i still don’t want to sit down and watch the whole thing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I have the same problem with ios and it‘s due to mine storage capicity. Iphone deletes „unnecessary“ storage automatically on your phone if you don‘t have enough. Open optc, wait for the long ass download to finish and then take a look at your storage capicity. You‘ll then see if it‘s enough or not.

Told this over aggressively in my face church guy when he asked me how do I know if I’m going to heaven or not if I don’t accept jesus into my life? I laughed and said ‘oh I’m already well aware I’m going to hell, at this point I’m just cutting in line to front’ the reaction was priceless and he quit bothering me. Win win.
Wow, I had no idea Brazil was that bad. Yes we are definitely heading down that road.  Cops here refuse to acknowledge any problems. Instead they think the way forward is to deny any issues and act like it’s the people’s fault for not trusting them. Distrust is a perfectly reasonable reaction to a stranger with a gun that has statistically been proven to be 4x as likely to be abusive, and has near legal immunity. Their level of delusion is insane
Jup, its insane.   Though Strikers with a full compliment of M Lasers ++ (10 damage) and SRM6+++ are also a tiny bit insane.

For the elites perhaps, but those who fight thosewars do so because their religious elders tell them to do so. They serve the leaders who start these wars because their religious elders tell them to.   Religion is a tool of the autocratic state. It continues to exist because it continues to serve this purpose.
I have now set up Deluge and Sonarr in dockers on Ubuntu. Waiting for a new episode to air to test it fully ;)  I have one question though: How do I change it so that Sonarr move files when importing instead of copying?
So true. As a paladin, if my tier sucked at least I could get the DK or the warrior one. Now if the raid set sucks, all the new armor we're getting in a patch does. And they said there will be more sets but I'll believe it when I see it. Sure, on release there will be more but with content patches I doubt we'll see anything other than the pvp and raid sets. No new sets for warfronts or anything.
On the combat, I had the opposite problem. Once you get a good blade you can cut through large groups like your a witcher. It felt to me like there was a good five-ten hours of hard combat where you had to use the mechanics and then you become unstoppable.
I had to manually disable the internal Intel & GTX1050 graphics cards to prevent massive lag issues in Windows. Otherwise, no need for additional changes.   It could be the current (latest) graphics drivers causing this issue but I haven’t had a chance to use DDU and try a different version: I did reinstall them with no luck.   I also have the 4K screen which is beautiful, no doubt. But are you going to spend $1,000 on a graphics card and then game on a 15” screen and laptop keyboard?  Then you buy an external monitor. Then a keyboard. And of course you already have a mouse. Then add the eGPU enclosure.  Honesty I’d build a desktop, which I plan on tossing this 1070ti into; and using all of the other components (mentioned above) with it. I’ll get way better performance than what I’m experiencing now.
Don’t over think it. I’ve been pregnant twice, the point in the pregnancies where I was uncomfortable was towards the end, when it obvious that I was pregnant.  And I wouldn’t have been offended if a seat wasn’t offered to me; I wore comfortable shoes. :)
No but he's still a below average QB who had time to throw the ball behind a great oline.     So if this question means you get a great game out of your QB every single game of course I am taking the 350+ yards and 3 TDs a game in this scenario. If it just means you get a Rodgers or Brady I'm not taking that. We saw Brady,the great offense ever (per drive), and an undefeated team get beat in a superbowl by a completely average team with a dominant dline.

I applied to Brighton, Coventry and Bath Spa in England, got conditional offers from all of them but declined.   Scotland’s cheaper so I chose Abertay University as my firm and only choice. I hold a conditional offer there too. My application to Aberdeen was apparently lacking something important so they just marked it off as unsuccessful.   I’m going to study criminology if I reach the conditions, which tbh shouldn’t be that hard.
Hmm im in Northern Ontario. i been to a few lakes and they were pretty bad for fishing i did find a new spot, plan to go and try it out maybe next weekend gotta get a new rod.

Everyone knows Price was off this year, yes the defence was bad but it was never great in all the years he was here. Weber wasn’t healthy the whole season, he got injured in the opener vs Buffalo.
Powerful over famous, absolutely. I hardly want to interact with the small number of people I know now, it would be torture to be well-known and approached by random people or paparazzi all the time. I do, however, think there are some things wrong with the world that I am benevolent enough where if I was given significant power to fix them I would do the right things.
Lupinus and dupes for Albea, Shayna, Teona and Fraise. I'm happy with it
Winnipeg, I've been rooting for them since Avs were eliminated. I am a Hawks fan and therefore like Byfuglien, I went to DU (and live in CO, which is why I rooted for the Avs in round 1) so I like Stastny (it was hard when he was a Blue). Also, Winnipeg hasn't won a high level hockey championship since 1979 and hasn't won the Cup since 1902 so they're overdue for another.
I start by sorting them all into genre/sub genre. Then from there it's alphabetical.  I'm currently in the process of dumping all my DVDs and upgrading to Blu Rays. So it's a bit of a mess right now...but when it all gets sorted out...I'm going to keep the Blu Rays together, and the DVDs together (the few that I'm keeping). Boxed sets and steelbooks are going to be separate from everything else. Boxed sets are just so big they need their own space (to save room on my shelves). And steelbooks look nice all lined up together that I want to give them their own area.  I don't have that many steelbooks (just some of my favorite movies and doing a full MCU set) but I think they deserve their own place.

I don’t think so - it’s not like Im an engineer. I’m a gs-13 trying to switch fields and move to a different region. I’ve also been applying in a bunch of hiring freezes. My resume is good and it doesn’t even matter because I’m a non competitive referral where they allow that. Even so I’ve only had four interviews. Two I got offers, one they cancelled, one I realized during it that the job wasn’t what it said it would be.
It’s likely due to the way the US federal tax credit works which was under Obama.  So it is actually his fault.
You don’t get it, do you?  Best of luck on all your future shitposts!   I’m out. You’re not even fun. Later pedostash.

I'm referring to games in general.  Regardless it's very simple, if you expect to pay next to nothing that's the quality youre going to get out of it. They have to make money, people seem to think that they launch the game and instantly make millions with no extra costs. Servers cost money, and they have to pay the development team. When sales slow down people will still be expecting content as well.  If you want a game that's going to last years instead of months it's gonna require a subscription or cash shop, and both are supposed to be optional. We don't know cost of sub or what's in the cash shop yet, so why not wait and see? Maybe it will be p2w, and if it is I won't play, but nobody knows yet.  How long do you think fortnite would last if nobody bought the battle pass (optional subscription) or cosmetic items (cash shop)?   People need to wise up and realize nothing is free, how many people here will go out and drop at least 50 to 100 at a bar or restaurant this weekend, yet are crying about these costs on something they hope to play for hundreds of hrs?

There are many different scenarios. Non-linear battles seem to have a greater impact. When I am above the enemy, what if I shoot the head first resulting in a 1 hit? Will 1 shot also cause 4 hits, hitting all 4 parts of the hitbox?

OP clearly should read the details about the Jian Gomeshi trial. We wasn't even into the D/s lifestyle, he was just in for some rough fucking with *consenting* women (and men!) - and it *still* came back to bite him in the ass and destroyed his career (even he was found not guilty; *by a Cucknadian court, while being a smarmy white male*, no less)
Yeah. From my experience tendencies, driving dunk, contact dunk, strength, weight and Posterizer all play a role in how likely a dunk is triggered over a layup.
Exactly. It’s easy to fall into the “I’m a worthless human being” trap when you’re depressed anyway, and having some ignorant people belittling you is hardly going to help matters.
To add to the one requirement;  A model cannot end a charge move within (<=1”) of any units it did not declare as charging target. If no charging models in the charging unit can get within 1” of any of their charging targets for this reason, the charge fails.   Source: CE 2017  Note:  this means you cannot *end* a charge move within 1” of an undeclared enemy unit; you can move models anywhere besides this, like straight past them during a charge movement and be within 1” of them for the purposes of your charge movement as a whole, so long as your movement does not *end* within 1” of those undeclared target/s.   Note 2: “if no charging models...” of course, as you said, you are only required to get within 1” of *any* of your charge targets for the charge to successful, this is GWs wording, not mine, but the meaning is the same.  It’s more of a clause to the rule.
I remember something about this. If you log out quit the game, hell might as well reboot. When you come back it refreshes your status on Bungies servers and it will appear.
lol the other day I literally sent a message to dispatch.  It’s x time I have x hours to get to location.  So my arrival will be...   I had a guy side swipe me.  Very minor damage but accident reports and getting minor shit fixed for roadworthiness... I was set back about 6 hours.    Dispatcher calls later  What time are you getting to first stop.  X time like I said in message.  You didn’t say x you said y  Nope I said x time now x hours to go and arrival time x  Then he realized he’s in a different time zone he decided I meant an hour earlier than I said.  Because he though I was calculating by the wrong time table.

I haven't played the board game, but based on other similar games I had a feeling that would be the case. It wouldn't really be what fans of WILTY want to see the NLSS crew doing.  If this does get up it might have to be a once off or a limited few times rotating through the extended crew if only a few people participate at a time. But you're right, this might be more aspirational than realistic.

I corrrcted myself
FWB- well in your case BFWB.  He’s using you. He’s waiting for his dream girl, his true love, the miracle that will save him.  And it’s not you.  At least not like this.  I apologize for my cruelty- but it’s better you hear from me then your replacement.  I was the BFWB that was never quite good enough to be ‘the one’. He even put a ring on it since no one else match my effort. Looking back I was better than he deserved.   Here’s some of my rationalizations: He’s been hurt before- he can’t trust -my love will heal him but it will take time to prove he can trust me.  He’s been neglected and repressed and if I show him how to love - he will follow my example.  He’s moody and I’ll be patient- he’s with it- they are growing pains.  He’s just more reserved and less emotional than I am.   He’s got you proving yourself, always wondering, on your best behavior.  You are always doing for him and he goes along, but doesn’t reciprocate quite as much?   If you pull away- then he behaves more like you want him to- like you matter and he cares?  He never says ‘I love you’. At least he’s not lying about that. But I’d bet he lies about other things. And it will get worse. I may just be projecting my experience on to you.   I know- you’re so compatible when you’re together, he knows you better than anyone. He was your best friend and then you fell in love. He didn’t. He won’t. She will eventually show up and you’ll be lucky to get a mumbled thank you. The longer you stay in this limbo to avoid the pain of breaking up - the worse it’s going to be.  I know- you are hoping he will realize what he’s got.  Okay so you help him. You pull back a little, make him work for it. Be a little mysterious, keep him on his toes a bit, turn the tables. Play the game. That’s fun, but you’ll always be playing if he’s a covert narcissist.   If he’s just lazy, selfish and immature - then you are his back up. He won’t claim you- he’s available for others - and they will show up and he’ll let you both compete.  You will either ‘win’ that round and get ready for the next one. Or he’ll dump you and you even lose your best friend - not just your lover. Or if you leave and don’t play - you will be punished- even if it’s just the silent treatment.   Not great choices. But you are gonna have to make one- this lull won’t last forever.
After playing around with it for a few days i have to say it's quite unintuitive and some silly decisions are made here.   To list a few:  * You swipe right to go 'left' to the previous app. Why not allow swiping left instead of locking in the Back key there as an obstruction? The back key has no use in this context and can be ignored.  * The velocity is very weird and changes with every action. At first one swipe all the way right moves by one app but then starts going down further if you keep holding the button (which is natural to wait a second when you're switching apps to see if you landed in the right place, so this causes an unexpected jump to the next app already)  * Again on the velocity, the fact that swiping back and forth goes between a different amount of apps on the consecutive 2nd and 3rd swipe is pretty weird and unnatural. For this to be useful the motion needs to be natural and this puts in a weird sharp learning curve of the actual function which means the user never really gets to where he wants effortlessly.  My main suggestion:   * One slide right should present the last app and then show the whole navigation bar as a full slider(the back button is unnecessary in this context, remove it). Dragging the slider then left should go between ALL open apps with granular haptic feedback (or a limit of last 10-15 apps) and not just go two apps back with a slow ticking 'next app' as is currently implemented.  * optionally, allow sliding left immediately towards the back button to just jump to the last open app directly without the app switch UI getting in the way.
This sub hates Pull-Ups. People love to downvote any pro Pull-Up post. I absolutely prefer them over regular diapers. Been pretty happy with the Northshore GoSupremes. Best adult pull-up currently on the market, in my opinion.

I had several bouts of food poisoning that really almost put me off traveling as long as I was going to go. It goes away, but it can take a while. Drink a LOT of water, eat some comfort food, see if you can’t get probiotics or probiotic drinks in the country you are in. It’ll pass. If it gets worse, see a doc.
This would have never been done on Twitch without getting banned for some stupid reason in the first 15 minutes. The best thing happened to him is getting banned. fuck twitch btw
i got the same. lyft is presumably paying for this out of their own pocket. i wouldn't go out in the boonies to do one of these even with the bonus, but if I'm out in the boonies trying to get back in town and get something like this I might try it.

OK I'm on that page with you.  I was not sure if you meant something regarding this thread or the top image or what. Whew! 👍
Yeah but that wasn‘t the original point. The original point was that a muscular, bigger man has a decent chance against a smaller, trained man. Above average height and muscular isn‘t exclusive to 1%.

Is it bad I downvoted Wendell? He left his loved one to go to Ghost Island, which pissed off the Kellyn crew. The advantage didn't really help him in any way, and he got targeted for it. The only good points is that he survived and didn't play his idol, but I didn't really think it was enough for me to not downvote.
Yeah I get it. It’s kinda shaped like a foot.
Good then we can give all that *preventative-funding* to my lawyers instead.
Some people just doesn’t want to do what’s best for the situation, rather prove the wrongfulness of others through action that may inconvenient both parties  I mean, isn’t what this whole sub is about?

mamamaya: This is why we can have nice things. Because of people like Taylor Swift who are genuine and true. She appeared in my life at one of my darkest times and has spent the past seven years showing our family unbelievable kindness. Kindness that I don’t always share with the world because I am fiercely protective of my relationship with her. I am also fiercely protective of her. Taylor could have very well likely invited me to that one concert seven years ago and that would have been more than enough for me. But she didn’t. She continues to do the most incredible things. I am forever thankful for the way she took so much of my pain and turned it into the most beautiful thing. I told her I couldn’t believe that the stars aligned in a way that had me at her concert hours before the anniversary of Ronan’s death. She grabbed my hands and winked at me with tears in her eyes. I don’t think the stars just happened to align that way. I think it has something to do with the Ronan/Taylor magic that seems to appear during the times in my life that feel extra hard. I think the coincidence of the other night was Ronan’s way of reminding me that he is always by my side. Thank you @taylorswift for the most unbelievable night and for never forgetting my son. You are the most incredible soul. #ronan #fucancer #reputationtour #rockstarronan #lookwhatyoumadeherdo

"Kate twenties" \- which I now realize is simply a typo \- caught my eye as I am older and always trying to get "hip to the slang"\*  my silly thought process: Kate... Middleton? ... isn't she older \- well, now she is... maybe it's like Cockney rhyming slang... maybe a "Kate" is a free\-thinking woman   \*as an example \- a student referred to me as "lit" \- in my day that meant "tipsy\-drunk"
I send my condolences. I rarely use lethals anymore that aren't throwing knives because it doesn't feel fun to me to cook a nade and get easy kills. The only S-mine kills I have are from flashbanging enemy mines in war and getting multis lol.
Delete fuck your opinion😤
What if it was something that was financially motivated? I wouldn’t imagine they were living some high rolling lifestyle but maybe it wasn’t for personal reasons. Maybe the killer had something to gain or wanted something of theirs (that we obviously would know nothing about or even that it existed). Or they witnessed something they shouldn’t have? Maybe it was just someone who was mentally unstable and the symbols were some kind of religious thing. Then again, the symbols and stuff seem too strange to NOT be personal.   If there’s anything I’ve learned about human behavior from my true crime hobby, it’s to expect the unexpected in cases like there. There are many mentally unstable people out there who are capable of appearing mentally stable. Maybe that type of person has some sort of trigger that the victims somehow pulled unintentionally and it was actually random.   Although the son seems shady. I think he should be investigated further. Could he have hired someone to kill them and then been the one to go back and clean, planting the DNA after cleaning?   I didn’t check out all of the sources so I apologize if my spitballing was answered in one or more of those articles.

You know what bugs me? The people who acuse others of being anti-semitic because you dont support Israel’s crusade to destroy Iran, or being a Mossad agent if you do support Israel in destroying Iran. You can never win. Cant we just agree we all have different views? Ive seen posts of people saying Israel is the aggressor being reported as antisemitic, why?

Wow this is terrible advice lol.  Using alleve / advil can cause peptic ulcers, which can be extremely dangerous and cause significant bleeding.  Abdo pain + rectal bleeding is basically an immediate ticket into the ER.  If it was rectal pain and a bit of blood after you wiped which stopped and only restarted when you poked it - that is less threatening but should still see a doctor at least "soon".   OP's story is quite concerning for gastrointestinal bleed and you should be observed in the ER to at least make sure things are stable, they will likely have you seen by a GI doc who will likely discuss doing upper and lower scopes.  But to re-iterate - abdo pain + rectal bleeding + some dizziness is an absolute go to ER

Very happy to avoid EL next year.  Without Santiago and Aogo, my confidence is... not necessarily massive. Losing by no more than 2 goals will make me ok with this.  Will probably also choose to watch Konferenz. Because there are a lot of games that are more interesting overall. If it's close I'll probably end up watching Stuttgart though :)
In hits, yes. Bumgarner has 42 with nearly a season gone. In RBIs, no. He actually falls pretty far behind Wainright then.  Mostly what I’m getting at here is this has a number of caveats.
I was a waiter at the time, one of the only dudes at the place. I had casually hooked up with two of my coworkers before; but this one girl, K, she was an opera major with blue eyes, blond hair, and one of the bestest booties I’ve ever seen.  One day near closing, a few of us are shooting the shit, and I can’t remember exactly how we got onto the convo that one of the other girls showed a cook her boobs. To which K said, she’d let me see her naked, OUT OF NOWHERE and in-front of other people.  That night we let out a lot of mutual sexual frustration on each other; we both couldn’t believe the other had quietly pined for one another.
I can see how solving the issue of shirts rolling up and gaping at the waist or back would be a positive.        Yet, as someone with a long torso who can’t even wear a one piece swimsuit without it causing major wedgies, i probably wouldn’t do this. I generally don’t enjoy having my crotch connected to my neck with fabric.
Ok boobie, your set up looks pretty decent IMO. I would suggest getting cheaper ram and a cheaper cooler. But other than that game away.

A buddy of mine is an AT&T employee and they all got an email from CEO Randall Stephenson this morning. I will copy the text below.   “A message from Randall   To: All AT&T employees worldwide  Team,  Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged. There is no other way to say it – AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake.  To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate. But the fact is, our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment. In this instance, our Washington D.C. team's vetting process clearly failed, and I take responsibility for that. Here (internal link) is more information on this issue, if you're interested.  For the foreseeable future, the External & Legislative Affairs (E&LA) group will report to our General Counsel David McAtee. Bob Quinn, Senior Executive Vice President - E&LA, will be retiring.  David's number one priority is to ensure every one of the individuals and firms we use in the political arena are people who share our high standards and who we would be proud to have associated with AT&T.  To all of you who work tirelessly every day to serve customers and represent the brand proudly, thank you. My personal commitment to you is – we will do better.”

Just a question, where do you see this "tagalong who only get by with the help of a bigger faction"?  We know for sure that you can "win" by using only PP and never allying/following the goals of the other factions. (There is a different "solution" against the Virus for all the 4 factions.)  We know that PP has its own tech-tree, even different PP-bases (potentially) having unique techs.  PP was usually mentioned somewhat as "Player Faction", while the other 3 as "big faction" due to the difference they have compared to the "neutral" havens you meet the same way on the Geoscape, the difference being several havens cooperating together (under the name of a faction).  I know almost nothing about Syn "unique" class(es) too, I know about NJ's classes due to the Demo featuring them and about the Mutog Handler DoA due to the coolness-factor (player-controlled Virus!), but I can't remember anything about Syn. Are they just a tagalong now?
Actually it can be. There's plenty of group activities and courses to attend. Just don't expect instant-buddies-for-life like friendship on the first occasion. But join in and be nice to be around and eventually you get to know people better. Whether that ends up being long term friendship or just pleasurable acquaintances - at the very least you got out, learned some skill/spend time on something constructive instead of hiding yourself at home where no one can find you.

Ah awesome, thank you. I've implemented a couple fixes between now and your initial comment so I got a different result. In this case searching for "Anderson Paak" came up with an error because the artist name has a . before Paak, and fixing that caused everything to run fine.   That said, a search failing over something so small is a bit frustrating, so I'll have to look into some way of recognising stuff like that. However that will take a while I think, since that seems like it'd be a complex thing to implement, compounded by the fact that I don't want to be spamming the lastfm api
Why do you care, narc?
Have you tried Shadowplay? It's in GeForce Experience and uses the GPU to record and encode.   You can stream to twitch, but I'm unsure of the performance impact on the 780. On 10xx series it's 1-2%. Quality is worse than CPU encoding, but consider it an option if you want to save a little longer.
Do they still update this game or nawh?

The love and bond comes. For me and husband, we started getting over the blues when we were able to have a full night sleep again (6-7 months) and soon after, I fell absolutely in love. He did too not long after me and would do anything for her.  Before that point though? We were discussing adopting her out almost every day.

All those parts would go wonderfully together! I just downloaded it and my 100i v2 shows up but I can only change 3 fan profiles that are stock so I will still have to use Link... Actually I need new fans for 2 heatsinks (3 fans) if I can dig into that credit card I would love to have some of those ML fans....... Between that and the Noctua's, but the Corsair fans are far more aesthetically pleasing, obviously. Noctua is finally catching on and they have a black series with rubber, Colored vibration pads! I would rather have corsair but performance-wise, man they are close call.

It’s got its pluses and minuses like any job. On the plus side i don’t have to deal with customers or a lot of the headaches of running a restaurant (been doing that since i was 17). On the minus side i am basically the grim reaper, report findings to the VP/owners, and am part of the stressful part of the industry that can get people fired for not upholding standards. I hate that part.
Holy shit. The level of mental gymnastics you have to do to reach the point you’re at is insane. So your logic is “Oh it doesn’t matter if he said this one massively important and ignorant statement, because he said other stuff as well”. I don’t think you understand just how misinformed and corrupt what he said was. That statement single handedly negated the rest of what he said.
In short, React feels like JS with a little sugar.   Vue reminds me of angular mixed with backbone. Custom attributes, templates, etc. I know there are ways to use jsx in Vue and whatnot, but I just don't see what you would gain.
I was confused when I read OP's question. I would have loved a DC of MD though. Maybe I wouldn't crash so much each time I tried to talk to a specific merchand or when I want to enter the shooting stand!
Wooooo! Hereditary Monarchy! Nothing un-American about that at all
I don't downvote, but I do point out the logical flaws of "I'm a legit multi-accounter".
I don't know if they've necessarily "normalized" the names as much as they don't take them too seriously.  In the movies, people generally talk about Tony Stark rather than "Iron Man".  People might call Captain America "Cap", but rarely do they say "Captain America".  There have been some jokes about "Spider-Man" that center around Peter having chosen that name for himself, and other people either not knowing it or not taking it seriously.  I think people usually refer to DareDevil as "The Devil of Hell's Kitchen", or something like that.  There are a few jokes about Dr. Strange's name.  People laugh at Peter Quill pretty much any time he tells people his name is Star-Lord.  Overall, I think it's not that they've gotten the audience to overlook the weirdness of superhero names.  Instead, they've made the weirdness and awkwardness of it part of the in-universe reality.  The characters know it's weird, which prevents the audience from feeling that it's weird that nobody in-universe thinks it's weird.
So there's a number then? If he is really corrupt and ends up taken down by the probe for whatever reason we could just sieze it back.

If I skip taking the medicine I take, I will have dreams that are totally indistinguishable from reality.   (So much so, that Im starting to believe the theory that when you die, your brain floods itself with dopamine and whatever else and that explains the afterlife experiences.)   Anyhoo.. had a dream that was just like my life, only just slightly better.   Being just a little better was harder to deal with when I woke up, than if it had been WAY better.
That is academic waffle used to justify archaic teaching methods and a counter-product strong distrust of industry.   Lopsided "useless louts" is more of what we need. We need a grounding in Maths, Science and English but everything else is completely optional.   My knowledge of Ox bow lakes, how to musically score, how to melt plastic, draw a teddy bear, play rugby, over analyze the book: Silas Marner. None of these are life skills.   I had to teach myself: how to pay bills, diffuse an argument, sell something, make a table, draw diagrams to display complex data effectively, all my computer skills, programming, research, how to write a persuasive or technical document.    We should admit to the fact that the vast majority of what we teach is bollocks. They should be options and kids should have the opportunity to:    * Social (how to debate, calm, express, etiquette, council) * Make a chair * Perform ground work (drainage)   * Book keeping * Sales  / Marketing * Programming/Engineering * How to use a search engine effectively * Technical writing  Project based learning.
OP never said he accepted the firearm, just that it was left with them, and OP clearly does not wish to maintain possession of the weapon.  OP states that the gun was to be used in a crime, self-inflicted or not.  Seems like a pretty good case to differentiate option of asking the police how to get rid of it from the option of going to a pawn shop.

It should sit on top of the finished floor.  You may contact your plumber and see if he just temporarily secured this and plugged so no sewer gas can escape into the dwelling.  If you go with the flange set to the subfloor like this, you should use a deep-set wax ring (just a larger wax ring than normal) when seating your toilet to this flange.
It’s still a bad idea regardless
I think a deaf person would really have to weigh in.  To me the biggest hurdle is just to know how rhyme is pronounced - that the y is treated like an I. From there they can treat it like an -ime and rhyme all day.   Then they learn slant rhymes. That -ime and -ine can rhyme together but -ime and -ite can't. I don't know if this would be a memorization/immersion thing. I'd be interested if deaf people struggle to identify rhyming patterns in school because of this.

I think it happened in reverse. Shaq did say chuck was babied which is why he didn’t win but Barkley said he didn’t have wade and Bryant to carry him up and down the court. That’s when Shaq flashed the ring.
I remember reading an article in a Playboy magazine from the early to  mid 1970's where the State of California were worried that organised crime was buying millions of dollars of real estate. It turned out that the largest single owner in California was the Catholic Church.   You can’t sue the Catholic Church, You won’t find a registration of some entity called “The Catholic Church” with its HQ in Vatican anywhere in the world.   Strangely enough the Catholic Church, as legal entity, doesn’t exist.  You can sue a individual Diocese depending  on each country’s legal type of existence for such Diocese.  The figures were 177 Million Acres in 2015 worldwide holdings,  which puts the Pope  in the top 5 of land owners behind the Saudi Royal family  and the Queen.
My only advice concerning getting your crypto information from YouTube is...don’t. They’re all people just pretending to know what they’re talking about so that they can fool the even more clueless crowd.  The “TA” people are even worse. Reading charts is on par with reading palms. It’s all nonsense.
As an ex-Atlantan.  Denver people are friendly but no one wants to be your friend.  I feel like that's also life in your 30s though too.    The food isn't as good/plentiful/cheap as Atlanta.  It's hard to describe but I miss places like Atkins Park, Fox Bros BBQ, Victory Sandwich.    There are a much more active scene.  Just about everyone does some sort of sport/outdoor thing.  So you can usually find common ground to talk to people about things like that.    The traffic is bad, but only relative to the size of the town.  Denver Metro is about half the population of Atlanta.  Overall the traffic isn't as bad as Atlanta, but that doesn't mean there is no traffic, it's just different.  I positioned myself in town to bypass most of the huge traffic areas on my commute though.  The RTD rail and bus Line I feel like is light years beyond what Marta has to offer though and they are adding more rails currently.    We still have Waffle House/Chick-fil-a here, so that's a bonus, but there are no Zaxbys or Cookout :(    All in all it was a good move for me and I miss Atlanta, but I don't miss the headache of living in Atlanta.

It’s even better running up on a camper in VR. So visceral Honestly I think the run n fun style is perfectly suited for VR since you can aim your gun without looking. Sort of gives the attacker the advantage because in 2D FPS you have to turn your guy which allows the defender to do the same  Only problem with shotgun rushing is sometimes gets you in awkward positions. I find that I forget to readjust my guy and I’m shooting the aim controller over my shoulder. Pulled my neck the other day doing it

Based on what Avenatti said on TV the other night, the $4.4 was just what he had proof of, but he expected the total to be much more.
True Crime Garage is super well done case wise and the editing is fantastic. Some people don’t like one of the hosts (The Captain), but honestly I love the show so I’m used to his personality. They joke around sometimes but it doesn’t take away from the story telling.  If you loved Serial and are obsessed with the Adnan Syed case then Undisclosed would be a good listen as they go a bit more in depth and over details. Rabia is a host on it with some other lawyers/professors I believe.  The Generation Why Podcast is decent. They have a lot of episodes and the guys are very thorough.  Real Crime Profile did great analysis of the Robin Hood Hills Murder (Paradise Lost film if that rings a bell) and the Meredith Kercher murder (Italy, Amanda Knox.) They’re lengthy and multi-part, one of the hosts is former FBI agent and another a criminal behavioural analyst so it’s cool to hear professionals.  The Nighttime Podcast does Canadian Crime and mysteries, very well done. I really recommend listening to the multi part episodes on Emma Fillipoff. I lived in the city she disappeared from and it breaks my heart, wish we knew what happened to her.  True Crime Japan Podcast is alright, not my favorite but it’s interesting to listen to crimes from another country and there’s a couple crazy cases.

started with around 1600 players in the club, currently on 3-400. Got Otamendi, Pope and Sane. No huge players outside of that, not higher than 84 i think. The weird thing is i got nothing from the premium Pl upgrades but all my TOTS was from the regular one with only 3 guaranteed PL players. Anyway, pretty pleased.
Mixon. If you watch his tape from last season he is a very talented runner behind an awful line. In his game against the Texans he was met in the backfield as soon as he got the ball 3 or 4 times, and 2 of those times he made nice jumpcuts (one against JJ Watt) to make a positive gain. Not to mention, Howard has bricks for hands and Mixon can add to the passing game, plus the Bengals have attempted to fix the offensive line woes.   Not to knock Jordan Howard or anything; he has produced in the NFL twice now, and he is a great zone runner with very good vision. It's just that he has a capped upside.   TLDR: Would rather own Mixon in PPR.

I had to go to a funeral for an 8 year old yesterday. There are no words.   A local rescue was having a meet and greet with a few of their dogs, so I figured I’d swing by and pet some puppies. The moment I kneeled down this dog came over and climbed up on me and leaned his head against me and I was just like, WHAT IS HAPPENING HOW DID HE KNOW I NEEDED A HUG? What a good boy.   He’s not ready to be adopted yet, but I hope he finds an amazing forever home. Unfortunately my schedule won’t allow me to give him the kind of home he needs. But oh how I wish.
You can take ‘unavailable’ options from the index data sheet, be it wargear options or the entire sheet. You’re supposed to use the most up to date points. It’s a blanket protection that GW clarified to ensure index legal-legacy models will be playable. (Codex Eldar brought it to a head)  For the purposes of OP - barring another change, either to the commentary or index via FAQ, a model or weapon setup legal today will remain so even if it’s not in the Codex due to the “no model, no rules” behavior.
I used to run the reddit meetups back when they were monthly.  For GrMD you'll want to do outdoors. One of the ones I had had just 10 people RSVP but 32 was the total attendance. Thankfully we did that one outdoors and one of our redditors at the times was in with the owner's of Gerda's and reserved their back area for us so size wasn't an issue.  A later one we had 51 in attendance, at Dave & Busters. We had reserved their party room though so that was fine too, but we only were able to do that as well from having an "in" otherwise that normally costs money to get.
Ooooo so you’re fairly new to hamilton! Thoughts on it so far? Enjoying it?
Maybe 20 minutes the first day and 10-15 the next.  I've slaved away at surveys that took longer and paid far less haha.
I work in a company and that's exactly what we do.  Probably some analyst came to conclusion that this is a good business idea: because it either forces players to do this, or forces them to quit. Probably they think that non-payers can be dropped.  Also this can be frustrating for someone who actually pays for the game.
I only made 4 meals so I don’t know. So far all the fruits taste good and I’m on my day 3!
what am i to do with this knowledge  jk enjoy ur garbage corn but probably don’t do that again cause eventually you’ll get sick
Awesome! I'm excited for a good co-op game with her.
psamathe is always up there. Dark horus was meta for a while who I think is still better than Sekhmet. Vanessa halphas (light lich) and triana also work well against Tiana cleave comps. The problem is Sekhmet does absolutely nothing after the first turn, and even she manages to get the first turn, she has to use 3rd skill (no derping), remove will (85% chance w/ maxed accuary) and reset (85% chance). Overall she's just slot inefficient.
I'm looking to do some inventory clearing on 5* weapons and stock up on some power stones but I want to make sure that none of the following weapons are actually really useful and worth saving.  Most of them are for characters I don't currently use/like.  Koenigs Knuckles (XI) - Prishe  Rune Staff (XI) - Shantotto  Tiger Fang (VII) - Tifa  Enhancer (I) - Warrior of Light  Thyrus (XIV) - Y'shtola - *I actually really like Y'shtola in this game but this weapon seems to not do much.*  Maverick (VIII) - Zell  Physician's Staff (XIII) - Vanille  Fuma Shuriken (VI) - Shadow - *I actually really like Shadow too and the effect of this would be useful normally but his MAX BRV seems too low for it to really matter.*  Skycutter (XIII) - Hope - *I like Hope and he's super useful in this game but it seems like the ATK Up I doesn't do much for him and can be received from like a million other sources now.*
He’s probably lying
It seems that IDW is the next iteration of the phrase "skeptic community": that is, an initially positive (if self-aggrandizing) term that over time gets used to describe entirely disparate people who span the entire political and ethical spectrum that is defined most often by its opponents.
It also doesn't help that the condition of the road is an absolute nightmare since it was never properly repaved after the gas pipe installation project years ago. I have no idea why, the project that completely tore up South Clinton took place after this and yet that was fully restored.
For instance, none of the above-mentioned shows with the possible exception of Firefly meet the editorial requirements of any other network.  I know we all love to shit on Fox, but we wouldn't have the Simpsons if not for them.

I don't know that I need more Han Solo films honestly. I do kind of hope that it's good though and this gives them a backdoor to actually do proper sequels to RotJ with a younger recast OT crew.
Msconfig? Noooo that has nothing to do with Linux. To test without removing Windows, install VirtualBox or Hyper-V. Or boot from a USB drive to do a dual boot using GRUB.

Votto with the stolen base?!? Jk they made him go back 😒
He’s not as talented? I like those guys a lot. A lot a lot. But I don’t think based on what we’ve seen so far we can dismiss he could be on the same level of talent as they are. Obviously it’s not a large sample size, but his efficiency was better than we’ve ever seen... 1500 yards from scrimmage and was splitting time with another back and really didn’t even play the first like 5-6 games of the season. I don’t think his fantasy value should be as high as those guys at the current moment with Mark Ingram returning, but I think saying he’s not as talented as those other guys is just a weird and unfounded statement. Based on what we’ve seen SO FAR, he absolutely could be right there in that tier.

Lol she got on him because he ain't know how to act right 😄😄. The relationship would have been chill otherwise. Remember they were fine at first then he let his dick takeover his thought process.

>  while Sabrina herself calls out fans,   So wait a minute here. The reason for the the comments you linked where a post from rhakall he directly adressed to sabrina. While a lot went wrong in that issue, I won't accept that people criticise her for linking the article and gave people the chance to convince themselves of rhakalls arguments, especially because doing so gives rhakall no credit. Do people really believe he made an public post so that people don't get to read it and because he didn't want an answer from her?
A perfect blep in the foreground.
While I appreciate the spirit of this, I don't really see an issue with it.  I don't think it's a good habit for us to impose definitions on people who are exploring gender expression. Not every transvestite is trans. Not every drag queen is trans. Not every AMAB person who likes to present femme is trans. Even if this person does decide to start identifying as transgender, saying that their lived experience and how they define themselves/their relationships isn't valid is pretty problematic.  The headline isn't great in the context of other media attacks on trans people, but transvestites are a singular community in and of themselves and they also deserve acceptance in the spectrum of gender identities/expressions.
That’s very creative and super cool
***OOOF***
Land sharks, similar to bulettes, they make great ambushes and can have wide variety based on your needs,

I wish the president and Pence would quit whining about this investigation. Everyday this thing continues on the worse it looks for Mueller and the people he is protecting.  Trump's approval continues to rise and GOP congressional numbers continue to narrow the gap with the Dems. GOP prospects in the midterms are substantially less bad than the were 6 months ago.  This is happening because they are making a martyr out of Trump and continuing to insult the intelligence of Americans with a Russian collusion narrative that is baseless.    Never interrupt your opponent when they are making a mistake.
What set did you get ?    The Ghost cube is truly a masterpiece but super hard, I suggest getting an Axis cube which was designed by the same guy and is more doable.    What you're doing seems to be mirIS - you're using the same four moves the entire time right ? Or rather two sets of four moves, one with the right hand and the same with the left? That's a great method because it's easy to learn and teach but it is *extremely* move intensive, 70 seconds is a pretty good time with it.    You'll be under a minute for sure once you get comfortable with the cubeskills one (which makes it easy to transition to 4LLL etc.)
Well, I guess I’d rather look intimidating than sick, and a bandana looks a lot better with all the band shirts I wear as opposed to masks.
No. Unless you have any ideas. 😉
There should theoretically be some. If I remember correctly, 2cb binds to a particular serotonin receptor, where as mushrooms act on multiple. So you shouldn’t feel a big difference, if any at all.
Do you have an NVIDIA GPU? If so, take your screenshots with Shadowplay (default hotkey is Alt+F1); they're *much* higher quality than in-game F6 or Steam screenshots.

And it still hasn’t replaced what was cut a few years back.   If 40 people a year were killed by terrorisim then we’d be having riots and demand for action. And I’m not politicising this by pointing out that the issue that appears to have caused it needs to be better funded.

Vote for what you support, regardless of party. If you can’t endorse the major players, vote for a third party, or write someone in. Your vote counts for one vote, so make it count. I know a write in has 0 chance of winning but for whatever it’s worth you are voicing your support. Infinitely better than not voting.
You got it my intelligent red pilled friend! Too bad half of America is sucking on unisom sleeping pills to lull them into sleepy MSM haven.

Children are generally less brittle than adults, so the more accurate analogy is a 50lb rubber ball and a 100lb glass ball.   You could leave the quality of the materials out, and yes a 50lb ball has less energy than a 100lb ball and must be dropped from higher to see a fracture. Taking the quality of the materials into account just provides another reason why kids are less hurt by a similar fall to the ground. That analogy was posed to make one argument clear, and extending the analogy holds if you add correct information.

Well, to be fair, they didn't *invent* racism, but they definitely perpetuated it and continued to ingrain it into society long past the point where we should have known better.  Our natural tribalism and xenophobia manifested as racism, but interaction should have cured that, if it were allowed to happen. But they made laws and kept people separate, spread lies and fearmongered.  But i agree with the sentiment. things wouldn't be nearly as bad, if the people at the top hadn't wanted them exactly as they were. And 100% with you on organised religion
Madridistas? Booing their own players? *Well I never!*
I’ll be honest, I don’t quite know where to start with this one.  Your personal anecdote doesn’t explain trends and isn’t really indicative of your local economy or population. So you make more money than almost anyone you know... either: - you’re highly skilled in a trade (*Good for you...?*) - you live in a poorly educated and low SES area (*so it’s no wonder your job at Walmart stocking shelves pays more than the 7-Eleven*) - you don’t know that many educated or skilled people (*take that for what you will*)  As for your assertion about salary, that’s all fine and dandy, but you fail to take into account what  *on average* means (so maybe a bit of education could help). One person’s high salary among a population of low earners doesn’t have much of an effect on an average value, so while *your* salary may be higher than your peers, *on average* uneducated individuals make less money than educated individuals. This isn’t even taking into account the number of possible employment positions and personal connections an uneducated person is unexposed to.  Finally, even if you manage to make six figures long before others in your cohort, how long will you be in your position? What kind of benefits are available, and what kind of risks will you have to take? Sure, someone working on an oil rig can make way more than me in a month, but I’d rather not work 16-hour days and risk my life around heavy machinery and dangerous chemicals every day; my personal health and satisfaction alone is worth more than money.   And let’s be real, how long could it take for educated peers to catch up and surpass your salary... less than a decade? How long will you be in your career, and is it long enough to make a financial difference? Do individuals in your field have careers long enough for it to make a difference?
Well which 1st party studios are left that could announce something? Maybe guerilla with horizon 2, but I guess thats too early. Next year we will probably get a PS5 announcement with new games for that machine.
I mean. A girl you meet randomly off the internet who is online actively looking to bang couples also might have slept w numerous other men in the last 48 hours. As long as everyone is practicing safe sex, this shouldn’t be an issue either way

Team Liquid has a legit chance to go 0-10 right now. This is embarrassing. This is the third game where we just bleed objectives after laning phase. Third game in a row where the vision is absolutely terrible. Like almost no wards on the map, or wards on the WRONG side of the map. Third game in a row where we have pretty much shit the bed in draft. They seriously need to fix EVERYTHING.   That said. I'm supporting the team no matter what. I love this team and I hope they can fix it.

Learn good coding skills and practices. Solve problems on Github. Build up knowledge and credibility. If you want to develop your coding, learn online on sites such as Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, Codewars, HackerRank, Codefights, The Odin Project etc.   Only suggest that you spend a few months at a time focussed on learning 1\-2 core programming languages. If you can do that and attain mastery, you will not have a problem of getting a job, but rather, a problem of choosing among various job offers.  Your aim and goal should BTW not be about getting a job, but being a top notch programmer.   Good luck.
Tempur-pedic Grand Bed (did not pay retail I snagged a floor sample for 80% off when I used to sell beds) and it is nice. It feels like a firm waterbed if that makes sense, no pressure on you at all like a water bed but keeps you in one spot so you don't feel like you are on a boat all night. Much more conforming then the cheaper foam beds and knockoffs I have seen because it uses better quality denser foam. However it is ludicrously expensive unless you find a floor model.   I have used cpap for a long time and realistically a mattress is a mattress. One isn't going to work better than another for cpap, unless you have trouble sleeping on your back or need an adjustable bed. What it will do is improve your sleep quality by providing proper support while placing as little pressure on your body as possible. The best advice I can give you is they are not one size fits all. Your size will make a HUGE difference. You need something firm enough to keep your spinal column straight when laying down. If it is too soft your midsection sinks in and puts stress on your neck and lower back. Too firm and the mattress doesn't confirm to your body and you get pressure points that will cause pain and tossing and turning all night. You want something that confirms to your shape and perfectly cradles your body, think like not being able to slide your flat palm under your lower back while laying down straight because the bed is filling the space. A good rule of thumb is the fatter you are the firmer you want, but you want the least firm that will still keep your spine aligned properly.  Find a local mattress chain and see if they have an outlet store where they sell floor samples. Some people think it is gross, but those mattresses are your best bargain. No one has ever slept on them and the stores usually rotate them frequently as new mattress models come out every year, just like cars. The worst thing they see is some kid scuffing them with a shoe. At the stores I worked these floor samples would need to be moved quickly and could regularly be had for 50-80%% off. Never buy a mattress for retail, they are marked up 80 or 90% in some cases. Especially if you find a good outlet you can find deals on $3000 mattresses for less than $500.   Now that I gave you that whole mattress primer Tempur-pedic is awesome, they feel the best to me. Since there are no metal coils pushing back they tend to take alot of the guesswork out and conform more to the individual laying on them, while still being dense enough to keep you straight. Latex beds are also a good bet, but they tend to have more quality control issues and break down more easily. If you want a traditional coil mattress definitely do a Simmons Beauty rest. They have individually pocketed coils and probably "feel" the best if you don't like foam. I won't suggest specific models you are going to want to lay on them and see what works for your body. Sometimes the firmer basic model will be a better fit then the one that is much more expensive but has a "pillowtop" which is industry speak for we added a cheap piece of foam on the top, unless it is a high end model. The gauge of the steel in a traditional mattress is also very important, generally the higher gauge will be thinner, cheaper steel and not last.

The above diatribe is professional propaganda and many of the posts that followed were written by very agreeable trolls & shills.  First, why single out people who have been fighting for patriotic causes for years?  Why throw Hagmann's name in there?  Second, implying patriots should focus on Infowars, Corsi, and Roger Stone as the heart of darkness is absurdity, foolishness, and an attempt to detract from the real enemy:  THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN, AND ARE, SUBVERTING THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND COMMITTING & FACILITATING ACTS OF DEMONIC EVIL.  Alex Jones is an attention freak.  So what?  Who cares?  I have followed Infowars for several years and they have usually been on the front lines of exposing evil and corruption.  They must earn income to pay bills.  They are in the information business and that is how all those employees are paid and how they expand business operations.  There is nothing inherently wrong or evil about earning money from selling books and providing news if that is how they earn a living.  Q may or may not be relevant anymore.  One of the purposes of Q was to gain support for our President.  If the President has the support he needs to proceed with his agenda, perhaps he is retiring Q.  The problem is...a large cult of Q followers are in the game and they don't want to turn their focus away from Q.  How about focusing on corruption and talking about the REAL heart of darkness and evil?

Well last night she was talking about how I was too obsessed with work even though I only seldom talked about it.  I would mention what I planned on doing in the morning, tell her how it’s going during the day, and at night I would say “Hey. I’m almost done editing these pictures (I’m a photographer). Just a few more and I’ll FaceTime you.  Then we’d FaceTime for about 5 hours and go to bed. I wouldn’t mention a thing about work to her.

It's so disgusting that the media feels the need to release photographs like this when it will only stir up hate and division. These men are *chican@*. Do you know what that means white people? It means they're members of a highly oppressed and marginalized group. You have no idea what these young people have been through, you can't have any idea because you as a white person will never have to endure living as a minority in a white supremacist country dominated by systemic racism. Judging these young men is just not okay.

Yeah.  Answering these calls only legitimizes your phone number as being active.  Asking for removal from these lists (either via automated system or with a live rep) is not honored is easily ignored because they remove you from one list for one "company" or one "product" and add you to another.  I've tried that as well to no avail.  The worst part is, these people are essentially protected by the same laws that protect us as consumers (no NPI may be divulged without authorized access), so stopping this at the root is a non-starter.  Once you're on a list, you're on there forever.

We had one particular airman come back from basic and I walked up on just such a happenstance - this airman along with about 3 other airmen, out of uniform, working.  I had no idea who any of them were, but I could immediately tell this guy was in charge - not because he was standing there watching, or yelling, or any of that, but because he was helping one of them get a cable stripped and then he was in front of the group as they grabbed an antenna mast and hoisted it up.  This group included people who had been in the unit for 4 years, but he was just naturally in charge.  He had an air of authority and responsibility about him, and didn't come off as rude about it or anything, he just took charge.  3 years later now, the dude's about to make the transition from E-4 to O-1, and I can't wait to see him come back with a butterbar on his chest.  I don't think I know anyone better-suited to become an officer than this guy.

if you're using an infuser and removing it, then it isn't grandpa style, it is 'western style'.   Grandpa style is when you put the leaves in the water directly (no tea bag or infuser), and leave them in during your whole drinking session, adding water as it gets low.  6-7g for a 16oz mug is a little on the high end for grandpa, but not much. I'd typically recommend 5-6g for that size vessel.
the new am album is growing on me. at first it felt odd, of course. the album seemed wrong in the sense that i felt like miles kane should be singing alongside alex, and that made me upset because it didn't feel like arctic monkeys. but i am starting to enjoy it after appreciating it for what it is. science fiction is a bop.
Yes that was me out-loud wondering & I do intend to have a go at it myself eventually. I get what you mean re the ventilation, I guess the intermediate adapters don't need to be inside the network adapter housing as there is a whole empty drive bay to use.  If I do it though, the SD card slot has got to be on the network adapter itself. The existing ribbon-cable mod specifically made it external (on the front) so it was easy to access.  I love it but I also want mine to be less obvious and easily portable between consoles.  Ie. not glued on!  Capacities don't bother me even now. You could hotswap for fun, and that is really what I am hankering for.  On a barely related note I swear I saw (on the web) a clone network adapter, with a USB type A port on the back.  Had I better cut down on my drinking?
I could have written this myself.  But not just Christian—also genuinely enthusiastic about things my mom herself personally likes (which isn’t many things, let me tell you).  Kodak moments to show off: yes.  Normal kid stuff or independent interests:  never; shame.    I’m sorry either of us had to go through this.

We were not gonna have the winning record, then we were not  gonna make the playoffs, then we were not gonna beat the Kings (because you know Kings experience), then we were not gonna beat the Sharks.   Now, it's turn to hear all the reason why we won't beat the Winnipeg, and the it'll be all the reason why we won't beat the Caps/Lightning.   We're in the midst of historic Leicester City like season, and at every step of the way people are not giving us any chance to win.  BTW, our regular season record vs the three remaining teams is 6-1, with the only loss coming with our 4th string goalie in net at Winnipeg.
There is no victim because it's such a baseless story, I haven't seen her being dragged or her life being ruined whatsoever because she is anonymous. She has nothing to lose over being anonymous. However I do see Ameer's name all over social media being called a "sexual predator/abuser" over one baseless claim. Let some more context come to light before you accuse someone of being an abuser/predator because you know just as much as everyone else, which is nothing. You going along and calling an innocent person an abuser or sexual predator is just as life ruining and illegal as it is to not believe in someone who is truly being abused. **But it is such a sensitive subject you have to be careful with what you say and how you say it because it has real consequences.**
Considering the anount of money being poured into the region and players getting paid a shit load just to roll over and get shit on and play poorly for the region had me not watch NA LCS at all since last Worlds. Recently picked up on MSI bc its international and my thoughts were confirmed. Its just bullshit seeing NA do poorly like we have so many resources and facilities and gaming houses and support compared to poorer regions
Thanks for the reply, I wasn’t 100% sure she had really thought it through (the giving up kids and choosing me) and it seems since the news of booking in for a vasectomy, she’s become sceptical of it, wanting to know all about it, wanting to come with me and now looking at places to move to - while she says it’s to ‘rebuild our relationship’ I don’t see how thays rebuilding...I don’t want to loose her but this behaviour is making me think she thought I was bluffing - if that is the case then I may have to think about breaking it up :(
Yeah Reddit is weird sometumes. I was just being pedantic

Klcc underpass to the lrt Station is full of interesting characters. In my 40 minutes of watching I saw :  A incredibly tall and dark skined African man who was dressed all in white and had a turban twice the size of his head   A lady that bleached her eyebrows, hair, eyelashes and had a tattoo of a dragon on her neck. Is this a gang symbol?   Arabic looking guy who wore clothes that looked like he was going to go explore the pyramids of Egypt, like the clothing you see in ''the mummy movies' completer with a shovel    A short Chinese tourist that wore pink glasses that were wider than her face and wore everything in pink and gold plus she looked  incredibly confused    A whole group of people wearing their backpacks reverse so that it lies on their stomach (is this a trend?)   A Chinese guy with a full on viking beard, a metallica hat, a singlet and addidas shoes   A malay girl with the malaysian flag as a tudung. Must have been feeling patriot   Some North east European looking guy( brownish looking hair, tall, very pale skin) who wore a full army uniform and was walking very fast

Same deal for a show or sports or whatever. No worries, especially if it's through their verified resale. I'm pretty sure the ticket goes through their system and gets transfered to you. At least with LiveNation when you transfer a ticket, it essentially creates a new one and voids the old one.

I think the Bolts started bad but also I think the way things went to end the 1st was a punch to the gut and the Bolts didn’t respond well.   I really hope this series at least goes for 6-7 cause this is just depressing. No excuse for this. Washington looks good but WOW Tampa looks God awful
Ooh, what are fine observations in that doubtlessly brilliant Cosmo article? Failure to keep the toilet seat down? Wearing stupid-looking golf pants? Hard-hitting stuff like that?
Only downside to Intel iPhone X is it work on Sprint, but Verizon will activate it on their network. You just wouldn’t have 1x CDMA backup coverage which is really isn’t needed on Verizon anymore. There’s been some testing that show the Qualcomm iPhone has marginally better data speeds in low signals but actual reception was nearly identical, like the Intel modem stopped working at -129 dbm and the Qualcomm modem gave out at -130 dbm signal. It can’t hurt to get the QC model iPhone though but nothing really to sweat about.
I love Virginia tobbaco and classic tobbaco but I think you would have to have smoked cigs before getting a juul to enjoy those flavors. If u just got the juul mango is alright but gives me and a lot of people headaches. Fruit and creme taste like straight ass and I would steer clear from those. Mint is alright. Cucumber is a great flavor but doesn't hit well. Cool menthol is also pretty good.
Hey, it’s your tumblr, so you do you 👍🏻  We need to make an FFRK art blogroll
This is a fault of RV (and Bardin as a whole). You will rely more heavily than most careers for your teammates to kill bosses. This is another reason I use the 1h hammer. It is Bardin's most versatile weapon, allowing you to seamlessly swap between fighting hordes and tanking bosses (notice I didn't say killing bosses). Bogging yourself down with a 2h weapon will often cause you to take some damage if you end up in a situation where you must tank the boss and deal with hordes (which happens quite often with randoms). If you can stay alive (and keep damage up, you absolutely can not hold block up and wait for specials to pile up), you can eventually kill every boss except the Troll. With the troll, you need to deal with all other threats first (as with most bosses but the regen makes it worthless to randomly damage the troll) and then focus on it exclusively until you phase it or the AI director makes you shift your attention (which ruins all of your progress most likely).
I make an exception for Octopath traveler because the battle mechanics are really fun imo.
I just found Counter mentality works better to close put the game. I used direct passing, pump to box. GK instruction Kick to Target Man.  I have 4132 DM formation that I always use against 4231, I changed my DM to Anchor Man to make 3 man defender. My RB & LB to FB-d/s, and 1 of my MC to CM-d with direct pass.   I stole 1 goal on counter by Ibra (37 yo that time) to put me ahead on away goal against Juventus in UCL semifinal.

Aww, Trump's only friends are mad at him.
So if the constructor is set up appropriately (MBK, SMS, HBK) the combination of resistance damage, electrified floors, 8 tile B.A.S.E., and Feel The Base its a tough combo to top from a constructor point of view.   A good constructor will be scrambling to lay down wood floors so that the kills happen inside the BASE to trigger the Feel The Base at 30 kills.   Sitting back though.... weak.

I'm not sure he's got the "work every advantage you can get to the max" thing that Bellicheck has. He's doing a good job of building a team and culture, but he's not constantly working the refs, he wants the opponents to match his game plan rather than finding their weak spots and digging at them in every play, and in general just being frustrating for the sake of being frustrating. (And deflating balls and recording opposing teams closed practices, and any other cheap cheating edge).  I'm not sure I want him to, because that's why I hate the Pats, but there's not doubt that's part of what makes him successful.
Well don’t let that distract you from the fact that Kansas beat Texas at football in 2016

The standards don’t get higher for food in the USA! 🇺🇸
Sure as a grand idea, but in practicality, it’s a mass-produced trinket basically that you can buy like in bulk from wal-mart. They get shipped around in warehouses in giant dirty boxes and piles, then all of a sudden once one is in your hands you better revere it and not let it touch the ground? Just seems kind of silly. Also, honestly I’m wondering why? What does it mean that people died for what it represents? All it represents is America. Of course people died for America to exist, just like every other nation really. I mean by that logic wouldn’t it be disrespectful to let a slip of paper you wrote “America” on touch the floor? That’s not even symbolic. It’s a literal representation of what people died for, it’s one step closer, yet it sounds ridiculous to adhere to that. It all just seems pretty arbitrary.
Yea your right but after you place one stair you should be able to see where it’s gonna be. That’s why I feel it would have to be a Toggle option as some won’t like it. I personally don’t think it be a big deal.

Skyrim on your horse... armor? My god. IT'S PERFECT.
PubB isn't coop though, same as Counter Strike, TF2 or Overwatch isn't a coop game - it's a team competetive game. Warframe is coop, Portal is coop - they all have campaigns to play, full stories you get to experience with other people. Sea of Thieves has very little content. Never heard of A way out, gonna check it out. Anyways, we really aren't in a golden age of coop - that one was from the Orange Box era, up to the second Dark Souls. You had a ton of coops, with Left 4 Dead, Payday 2, Souls, Trine, the first Magicka and a crapload of others come to mind.

First of, I don't think you should pay ranked with this attitude. Play casual, you will be more happy.  Now, the combo deck was invented by Sipiwi94 I believe, made more popular by Kripp, but he gave the credit for the initial deckbuilding away, so its all fair play.  You deal with the deck by either killing them faster than they assemble it, or disrupt them (milling, dirty rat, potion of poly, deathlord pull). Its a combo deck as any other with the exception of loatheb being a weak counterplay as opposed to traditional malygos builds, etc.

Since you like Poesie's strawberry note, I **highly** recommend both **Strawberry Party** *(juicy sweet strawberries, delicate white almond cake, whipped cream)* and **Cloudless Sky** *(Apples, strawberry and rhubarb sprinkled in sugar and wrapped in tender pastry, a big cup of chamomile tea, a tiny house in the Nova Scotia woods).*     Strawberry Party is quite literal--once it dries down, it smells exactly like a strawberry shortcake. Heavy on the strawberry, with the whip cream serving as a nice balance, and the cake note not really present, except to round things out.    Cloudless Sky is almost all strawberry for me, but the rhubarb/pastry almost make this a fall-like strawberry, rather than spring/summer. I don't get much of the tea or sugar, but it's definitely less sweet/girly than SP.

I’m already on the local lists for kidney and marrow. My thoughts are with you!
The US has devolved into a system of oligarchs close to Trumputin. And his base will probably never realize it because they're programmed to use "librul tears" for sustinance. It won't matter how bad things get for them, how many times Trump betrays them, or how bad things get for Trump in the Russia investigation. They are programmed.
Our group has been playing 5e since it released the dmg and phb. We never had a single nat 20 on death saves, until we began COS in September. Since then we've had at least 10 probably closer to 15 jumps back to 1hp. The morning lord truely shines in strahdville.
Bah after 1400days of PAD where I saw all my friends start, put in 700+ days, stop  the game is stale. The new mechanisms really make PAD feel like a whole new game to the one that I absolutely adored.   I get your CR argument though, once u get at 4k it takes long to get the card lvs to climb ladder.
Really? Does it happen in dark mode? Maybe I’ve just never noticed it

Why are you bringing him up? Because you're the one with a narative to push. Enjoy being mad.
Doesn't XV focus on character development, though? That's the crux of the brotherhood thing and why they spent so much resources on an insane amount of ambient dialogue. Your comments sound like you're inseparably pairing story and character development together when you can do one or the other.  I've never seen a series that focuses on story like FF does that also sabotages itself in like every entry via a left-turn into insanity. Even IX, which I consider the best from a story-perspective throws its coherency out the window in order to have space stuff and soul machines.
I love these! Very relaxing. I haven’t had any trouble with the ones I’ve used.
This sub allowing shitposting now?
We decided to call her victory (vickey for short) and put her passport name down as Lyudmilas victory.
So all of this shitspewing is because the media decided to take NSH under their wing this year? That's it?   Seems pretty unwarranted, tbh.
No way. You can't take someond like cold who was only really good in the context of his team and compare him to shox who single handedly carried in 2013. He made LDLC the best team in the world for solid 6 months in 2014. Coldzera cannot carry like that.
As i said in a previous comment >Now as a pro-hindu I do recognize the fact that the left narrative cannot be combated if we just stick to a neutral tone, cause if we do the left will eventually take over because they don't play by the same rules that we do. It isn't tactically sound. They attack people with emotion and fallacies. There is a need to stop the left narrative cause it is bordering on extremism right now. But for that you cannot create a right wing echo chamber cause it will do more harm than good, it will give you a sense of accomplishment while in reality you would have done nothing. Like how randia atttracts only the left crowd this sub will only attract the right one. it would be nothing but counterproductive.  Like you i also want to win. Fuck virtue signalling this has actual effects. If you become an echo chamber you will produce loonies as randia has and when those loonies by associating with RW/Hindus act they will make us loose credibility which will result in left coming back. And this cycle just goes on and on and on. But the games changed the internet is here and the only way to win is to establish credibility long term so that the current leftist thought dies out. I am too, frustrated but what we have to think isn't just about right now but long term. I have a few ideas to challenge the narrative created by randia but that's a matter altogether different from the integrity of this sub.

“Necessary” means “needs to” or “in every case.”  I’m being a stickler but what you said is actually incoherent. When something is “necessarily” the case, it’s a very strong statement. It means it’s always the case. “All oaks are NECESSARILY trees.”   So, if it’s conceivable that a master kills his apprentice or the master otherwise does not die at the hands of the apprentice, it’s not NECESSARILY the case that the apprentice kills the master.   This isn’t a discussion about Star Wars but about language, deduction, and necessity.  Be patient with me. I’m an autist. :)

His mum claimed it was Asperger's but his doctor claimed atypical autism. Which could mean he was so high-functioning he was above Asperger's or it could mean he was a little below it, it was basically just a catch-all for any autistic who didn't fit into the other categories.
Wanna bet that republicans are behind a child trafficing ring and pizzagate is another wildly insane projection?  Cause I sure don't, because every day it's looking more and more like they are the demons they keep telling us democrats are.

Hey PK, are there any current theories or sources on where all this money Cohen received might have gone so far? No doubt Mueller has been working on this--but if Cohen really had to use his home mortgage to pay Stormy it would seem he's pretty strapped for cash.  If we know why all this money dried up or where it went to we may be approaching the final destination
The builds I have played in reaper mode so far for racial tr's have been...  *Pure barb* (get ear smash it is really good) *Melee artificer* (this was before renegade so it's better now) *Wolf druid* (so much damage and healing it is so good. And fun!) *18 fvs/2 monk* vistani blood of vol wisdom to hit and damage dual dagger build (great healing, dcs, damage, and dodge) *Thf paladin* *Vanguard paladin*  Those all worked really well for reaper.  The builds that didn't work well were...  *Assassin rogue* (too slow to build up, no healing, hard to solo) *Dwarf melee Throw your weight around acid sorc w/dragonmark for double earth grab* (would honestly work if earth grab lasted longer than 3 seconds and the dc worked properly)
How dare you mention those plebs in the same sentence as Ronke
Yep, but Keen 2-0'd IG and LFY in the Supermajor quals, they lost the final to PSGLGD. They also beat EHOME, VGJ-T and LFY to come to GESC, coming from the lower bracket after dropping a series to LFY, they won the finals 3-0. They look to be on a roll.
Cousins have been marrying and reproducing since...well...forever. It's really not a big deal. It's not even considered incest in most of the developed world.  The dear of cousin fucking comes from having a baby with genetic problems, but there is actually a really, really low chance of that.   The social implications, however, would be terrible, so if you plan on persuing this, try not to fall in love and don't have babies...it's going to suck.   Technically, we all come from someone who fucked a cousin at somepoint...it's fine.
Nuh-uh! I'll beat you to it!
Physical appearance is obviously not the issue as several trans women look no different from the "average" afab body and most afab people on the transmasculine spectrum look much closer to it in this regard.  What I'm asking is: is including trans women with cis men as AMAB meaningful in anyway when discussing rape?  I'll define a new group: Xers, who I define as anyone who is a cis man or has red hair and Yers who is everyone else. I now say:  The reality of the world is that most Yers experience sexual violence at the hands of an Xer. It is therefore to be expected that many Yers be unconfortable and scared in the presence of an Xer and therefore should not be placed in with Xers in a rape shelter. You may say that red headed women should be included but the reality is that they are Xers and Xers commit the vast majority of violence agaist Yers.  Or with men:  The reality of the world is that most women experience sexual violence at the hands of a man. It is therefore to be expected that many women be unconfortable and scared in the presence of an man and therefore should not be placed in with men in a rape shelter. You may say that trans men should be included but the reality is that they are men and men commit the vast majority of violence agaist women.  Is what I say not true? But is it really meaningful to include trans men or red headed women in with cis men when discussing the issue of men, or am I conflating two groups that are behavioraly different in this particular regard.
Lillian would see a 10 year old looking girl in a tree reading. at the bottom of the tree she would see two dogs and a cat. a golden retriever, a pug puppy and a black cat on top of the golden retriever. all of them resting. in the tree the girl has a bunch of other animals. a salamander which is on the book she is reading, two kittens on her shoulders who are sleeping. a mouse on her head, two guinea pig in her lap, and a frog on top of one of the kittens head.

But tbh being a teacher is a noble job , parents do this to me to . I wanted to become an entreuprenuer but now due to parents I am working as an IAS officer in Mizoram .

Whore also fucks are servant its honestly abhoring . I hate her , I want her to shut up , bitch also told me I have a small penis .
A couple things...  Did you say ‘I can’ when you meant ‘I can’t’?  I’m Canadian. I play/like hockey. I think cheering for a Canadian team you don’t normally cheer for is nonsensical and shows a lack of understanding for the game and the individuals that play it. Look at Vegas’ roster. Tell me who the real ‘Canadian’ team is.   Does it blow your mind that I have a different opinion?   “I like Canadian teams more than American teams” is solid logic though. I can see why the Jets and their roster of Canadian boys are your logical choice.   I’m not trying to get under your skin. I’m trying to understand the mindless phenomenon that is ‘cheering for the Canadian team’.

This is true.  I'd be very interested to know if Matt also had second thoughts about allowing it as DM.  It's already pretty clear that Matt was not expecting the night to go in this direction.  Whatever he had planned for them to find in the Cobalt Soul archive... it probably wasn't what he ended up awkwardly dishing up form his worldbuilding notes.

I know.  And I'm supposed to be on a fucking diet so I fit into my goal pants (which are a size 12 and I'm currently around a size 16) before my birthday (which is in September). The last couple of days have been sorta baddish but I figured all the exercise I did plus all the calories I burned at work (I work in a kitchen) sorta cancelled out all the shit I ate. Not today though, when I barely had the energy to do anything but still managed to get the house cleaned up a little and did about 9 loads of laundry (all but like 3 of which got folded/put away).
I get mine online from a company that has been consistent in their quality.  We first did it for pain and got reds.  Then we tested a white at a trying time emotionally and it was very helpfull.  While I have only had one source and never did storebought krat, we have never had a single bad experience.  To be fair, we dose no more than 3g a day and vary strains at times.  We are not 'heavy' users.
Holy ohmygosh CONGGRATS IM UGLY CRYIG W U
If you just insult, you don’t have an argument to counter what is said. Proven facts of debate and conversation. The people insulting, that’s all they know what do about the subject, because that’s what they were taught. If I pop my MAGA hat on and walk the streets for 30 mins. The harassment and physical danger I’d be in is palpable. All the Right wants to do is talk and teach.
Thanks, I’ve been doing a lot of chest workouts lately... but I don’t skip leg day.
my transistions around the ship aren't bad, although lately since I went to taking full salvage ive started noticing hitches when moving around the argo.  but the loading screens, ugh, only game ive played since going full solid state years ago, where ive actively thought, wtf, why am I staring at a loading screen?!

haha sorry OP. that made me chuckle. ive been on similar receiving end from stupid bull shit that happened to happen when i was drunk.   one time came across this gnarly potato bug or some fuck shit of a gnarly motherfucker under the kitchen table. went in for the kill with like 20 paper towels wadded up. it turned out to be a sporty fucker, some chairs and table got rattled, maybe a vase was tipped over, but i got the son of a bitch.  needless to say the family was not happy to wake up to the racket and mess
All parts of the dandylion are good for you, I like the leaves most, only issue is dogs/drunks could have pissed on em..
LOL great debate skills there kiddo. Literally everything I wrote there is factual with much of it coming from personal experience as an amateur boxer. But no, some kid who sits in their gaming chair all day either 50 pounds overweight or underweight knows more than I do. Keep it up couch fitness expert!
I was responding to what themostdopez about him/her feeling insecure after using social media. The second sentence was regarding the normal conversation. I was not clear at all.
She’s not my favorite character but Sansa is a survivor, whenever people hate it or not. She did survive King’s Landing (Joffrey and Cersei) and Ramsay (on the show). And are you really comparing “rape” to BSDM? Seriously? We only witnessed him raping her in the night of their wedding but it’s implied he did it several times. Sansa started off as a naïve teenage girl, brought up in a place of wealth and privilege. What did you expect her to be like? Not all girls are tomboys like Arya or Lyanna (Stark). Lyanna Mormont was raised by strong and warrior women, her mother and older sister (I think) died fighting for Robb. And Sansa realized fairytales and knights in shining armor didn’t exist after Ned’s death. She admitted she was a stupid girl with stupid dreams. She was just a child.
not sure why a virtual market makes any difference. Lots of high value markets are virtual - such as virtual currencies. Whether or not it is in a video game makes no difference as the process is the same and is funded by investors. Once investors go the market will crash and whilst some people will be able to get items they cant afford it will make the items more and more worthless to people. With the market crashing people buy less keys and psyonix make less money. Does that really make sense?
Right on! I just replied to somebody's comment with what I discovered about tailgating policies at the Coliseum. It's definitely allowed, but they have some strict rules on where. Will be creating a followup post closer to gameday.

idk how he's calculating that, unless he's just going to invite everyone to configure... I don't think we've gotten to Day 2 res holders in the US yet, have we?  Day 1 US reservations can't be much more than 80k, and ~20k(?) of those are already built, so assuming we're still going with first reservations get their AWDs first, those of us who reserved on Day 1 shouldn't be looking at much more than a 2mo wait... back of napkin math though, so I could be missing a major factor.

I don't think this is a discussion that is possible to have on this sub. Lots of folks here seem to be pretty dogmatic. I do think it is a great discussion.   r/personalfinance has several threads about pros and cons of Dave Ramsey, that go into details about the investment issue and the huge amount of success many people have had with the program. There is also a "Dave-ish" flowchart over there, but which emphasizes different things.
When I was first starting high school I had to choose my elective and the principal was nice enough to walk me though them. I was in her office and looked at the list of electives, and instantly I knew what I wanted to take; robotics. The principal was really nice and signed me up for robotics. The next day I went to my robotics class and was a little intimidated by all the older kids who looked like sophomores or juniors. I talked to the teacher and he was confused why I was in the class. Turns out the class wasn’t meant for freshman, and there were no freshman allowed. I was already in the class though and that was that. In this robotics class I met my best friends who I know and love to this day six years later. All because my principal forgot.

After yesterday's bullshit where dirtsheets couldn't figure out if Vince was okay with fans walking out during Joe/Roman, I've decided to stop giving a shit about what anyone says about how Vince feels about any given thing, until I hear it from a legitimately credible source, i.e. people who were there. Like this article, for example. Shane McMahon himself is telling the story. Not some random asshole making shit up for ad views.

It sounds like you’ve got your confidence in order which is great man. The downside to NoFap are indeed the flatlines, I find I can start feeling pretty lonely which leads to as you say, more needy and desperate moves.  That’s something I’m still working on myself man and I guess it comes down to getting used to all this extra libido demanding we go out and seek affection.   Just try and remember that she is not “the one” She is simply a woman to which you are compatible with. There are plenty of those in the world and if nothing comes of this relationship, you will probably find yourself looking back 10 years from now with a wife you haven’t met yet, thankful that things worked out exactly as they did. Life is a roller coaster like that sometimes

OMG, now Q has linked to this BS which convinces once and for all Q is psy-ops. Alex Jones helped get Trump elected. Thats why Soros is backing law suit after law suit to try to break Alex Jones. Roger Stone has been Donal Trump's good friend for over 40 years and he was very helpful in getting Trump elected. It was Dr Corsi who originally reported that a group of military/other leaders approached Trump to run as early as 2013.   Be careful who you're following. They want you divided   Yeah, they do and you guys are falling for it hook, line and sinker.
They should've just continued doing it even as only 4. It had only like 4k hp left the jungler was dead and Ryze was bottom lane.
my wife hasnt had much in the way of symptoms, but it is a freakin sight to behold when it does happen. Heres some interesting ones:  * Pregnancy Brain: Theres this song "cant stop the feeling" by justin timberlake. In this one ellen episode, she thought the lyrics were "its electric" when actually its "just imagine". I like to sing "its electric" because it makes her laugh. The other day, i did that, and she COULD NOT remember the actual lyrics. her guesses were nowhere close. It was freakin hilarious, she knows that song backwards and forwards.  * The Trash Can Debacle: We have a room mate. To be nice, when he gets home from work, be brings the trash and recycling in on trash day and 99% of the time they've been collected. Last week, the dudes were late. My room mate operates on autopilot/routine to the point where you'd think something is mentally off with him. He brought the stuff in, didnt bother checking it first. There were like 3 cardboard boxes in the recycling, trash was empty, so i can see why he just rolled it in. Wife comes home and she's like FREAKING OUT that the trash wasnt picked up. "Why was this brought in? who did this? did you bring it in? Why wasnt it checked first?! The trash guys just went past! We missed trash day, now we have recycling left!". i went outside, saw that they were making their way back up the street. I rolled the recycling out there, waved them down, apologized. Wife was immediately the chillest person after that, shocked at her own mood swing. It was pretty entertaining, it completely fucking ruined her day when the trash didnt get picked up. She had no clue what to eat for dinner, couldnt tell if her sugar was low, couldnt tell if she was hungry or not, she just blatantly stopped functioning. Scary, but also cool.    * Emotional Spurts: I got her a mothers day gift since she wasnt expecting one this year. She couldnt read my handwriting in the card, so she kept cracking up while reading it. I oculdnt read my own handwriting either, but w/e. I went upstairs with a pounding headache and tried to sleep. She IM'd me later and said she was on the verge of tears. Next morning, she said she had bawled her eyes out later that night. Then started hilariously laughing after remembering how hard the card was to read. Then she put the gifts on in the morning and started bawling her eyes out again. And then she proudly showed everyone at work and then almost started crying again.  * Roadkill Sorrows: she saw a dead cat that looked like one of our cats on the side of the road, dead. she started bawling mid sentence and had to hang up her phone call with her mom till she got control of herself.    She has had 0 morning sickness. she's had CRIPPLING fatigue. no real food cravings, but im doing a pretty good job of keeping those in check (ie providing everything at the slightest mention of anything). She is now at week 23 or so, and is having trouble picking stuff up off the floor, tying her shoes, etc.

Hello All Im new to the rep life and have been exclusivly buying from Tina. I love the communication the pics and that she accepts payment throught Aliexpress, super easy!! Ive purchased 8 items since undercovering the rep world. My last purchase of the BB Noe in the azur print was a disappointment. What was pictured is not what I received. At first she was very accomdating and immediately offer a refund and of course I was excited like I found the perfect seller who has intergrity with their products and completely offeres the 360 experience to their clients. So I take a picture of the package it came in and ask should I send it back there and immediately she responds with a “no here”..... and never gives me a place. I let it ride because I get she’s busy she has a life plus multiple clients so I respond in the am saying “Hey Tina dont forget the address and can I order the bag again”......nothing. So now days go by and Im thinking is something wrong let me check on her welll being. Guess what I get a response so I of course I mention the return and ......nothing. Is this the norm?? Is she done with me?? I really like ordering from her the process is so easy and I get the products in a week.
I stickied it because I was drunk with power. And also drunk.
The fact that you think we’re becoming lap dogs shows you’re just looking at the surface level of the raid lore. Vault of Glass didn’t even have a story, it was barely described and there’s still a lot of details we’re iffy on. These Raid lairs are doing exactly what they’re meant to do, advance the raid plot and give us a badass fights with it. We haven’t even played the new one so hold your horses.

I highly recommend that you videotape your dog playing with other dogs and then watch the videos later to examine what is really going on.  It is very hard for us to completely parse dog body language in real time, and looking at video makes it much clearer.  You (or perhaps someone with more experience "reading" dogs) will be able to see whether your dog is really okay with what is going on.  Whether he is giving other dogs signals that they are ignoring.  Whether he is having a good time or not.  Personally, I really prefer one-on-one play with dogs.  I think they do it better and there is less chance of misunderstanding between dogs who are really well matched with temperament and personality and play style.  I think play dates are a much better way to go than the scrum of a dog park.
Whooosh
Maybe Stark's new sheild teased in homecoming will do all that in A4.  But now that you mention it, the sheild/Guantlets BP gave Cap seem lie hand-me-downs.
I’m not a fan in general of people claiming whatever role they have is the most difficult or important. It only serves to put others down and pat themselves on the back.   Even within industries, there’s a range of difficulty and risk. For example, an old classmate of mind is in the military and posts about making the “ultimate sacrifice” and risking their lives every day for “freedom.” They have a desk job in Hawaii, haha.   I’m more inclined to express gratitude on a case-by-case basis. I have another friend who works with a lot of homeless LGBTQA youth. Sees lots of really messed up stuff, the product of years of abuse. The friend is always on call and has used their own money to help the teens. Without my friend, I’m certain that some of the kids would not still be ablibe today.
No need to bring race into it. Nothing to do with colour, what about the brown Hindus and Buddhists killing Muslims, the black Central Africans, the olive Arabs and the pale East Asians. This idea that White=Evil/Racist is toxic and haraam. I know your comment is about Americans thinking they are freedom fighters but no need to use race labels, your argument automatically becomes weak and void. Peace akhi/okhti

It's easier than you think...I know folks in my area who have done just that.  Buying a steel home and doing the project management to build and outfit it, is very do-able.  You buy the land yourself with water and electric already ran, you buy a pre-fab steel home such as kodiac steel home raised model, build a detached garage.  All very affordable compared to traditional stick built.

I play a handful of games on PS4 and PC and one thing that throws me off a little is going from 30fps to 144fps when I swap. Usually more is better but sometimes it messes with your timing \(Rocket League took forever to get used to for me\). You might be experiencing some of that, and you also might have graphic settings at a level that may increase input lag.

Exactly, I’m not sure what’s being argued here.  I believe a lot of planes either need slight buffs and nerfs, or need to go down some BR.
Well fuck you too, my kind friend.  The reason I don't like that change as a support is because there will be a strong timing at 5 min where your team needs to take a stance on runes. I don't give a shit about having less money, support items are cheap enough nowadays.   But the whole momentum of the game will change, dictating a move from midlane at the 5 minutes mark (whole bottle refill between 2 usual rune spawns? Well while I'm here, I should as well gank), meaning there will be need to target your vision game at the ennemy's bounties, hence warding/dewarding almost the same 2 spots in every game around that timer.  That's actually a way to reduce the entropy of the whole early game, and to lessen the use of many ganky and roaming supports.   I hope I'm mistaken, and that it won't cause such a disturbance in the current rythm of the game.  Plus, that's kind of a huge nerf to side lane wisp.
I absolutely LOVE PenPal! Know if anymore NoSleep or Ceeepypastas that made it into books?
> Radical Islam != Islam  Fair point. Was it Radical Islam when the Prophet PBUH besigied Mekkah against the Pagans? Was it Radical Islam when the Noble Caliphs invaded from Tours to Cathay? Or Radical Islam when this 'Jews were "cursed and changed into rats" in Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:54:52' was wrote? Was it Radical Islam when Caliph Mehmed V raised the Sword of the Prophet in 1914 within the Hagia Sophia declaring Jihad on the British Empire, French Empire and Russian Tsardom?
You are the one making a big deal here; you yourself admit to laughing about your allergy,  and the waiter was nice enough to humor you and go and check to make sure the vegetable you're allergic to wasn't in the dish you wanted to order, so really this is a complete non-issue that you're blowing out of proportion.

I’d love to think that, but I’m not falling for the “big update” trap with Siri anymore. Now, I’m firmly in the camp of I’ll believe it when I see it.

I need the help of some tech savvy people if possible. I just bought Immortal Redneck and my left joycon is drifting whenever I move the analog in the top right (to describe it the range is from 12:00 to 03:00 if it were a clock). I thought my joycon was bust but this literally only happens in this game, I tried every other game I own and I can't replicate this issue at all so now I'm not sure if it's a bug only I'm experiencing or if it's a setting I'm being oblivious too though I tried messing around with all the settings with regards to control. Has anyone else experienced drifting with a specific game?

CC/more range) than just "stronk attac is stronk"  >Stances should change/buff weapon stats  More incentive to use more than just one stance.  >Being able to switch between stances   The reload button could need something to do.  When dual wielding: Hold to switch, instead of reloading secondary.  Extra:  >Stance specific Idle animations  Purely cosmetic, yet i'd like to see a stance whenever i equip one.
Suggesting it in the first place is profoundly retarded. Why even make idiotic suggestions that will affect the life of the game? It would either be too unbalanced or may as well not even exist in the first place.  What part of REVENUE drives the game is complicated to you? Successful businesses aren't into self-harm.

The beauty of banking options is that you don’t necessarily need to choose a bank with long term loyalty in mind. As a youth/student, every bank or credit union in your town should offer you a chequing account with no annual fee. Comparison shop (just bring up all their webpages side-by-side) and choose the one you like best. If you go to Cineplex a lot you would like Scotiabank’s Scene points feature. Stuff like that.  The automatic savings thing is a feature you can opt out of. If you follow the Money Steps in the sidebar you will have a budget and savings plan of your own, but if not it’s kinda nice to be saving small amounts without really noticing.

The problem with old Vulcan was that he only really did damage. He had no real CC, and even when you wanted him to do damage, he didn't do very much. His damage was so slow because he was reliant on his turrets. That being said, the fact that the turrets had such a short range meant that he would need to somehow keep his enemies inside the range, an ability that he didn't have outside of Curse (basically today's Horrific Emblem).  As a guardian, he had no initiation at all, but that doesn't mean his defensive play was all that great considering, his turrets died so fast.    Turret characters work in FPS games because turrets usually have a very long range and DPS characters have a similar range and damage output, allowing for counterplay from range. In Smite, this doesn't work because if you're close enough to hit Vulcan's turret, you're generally close enough to be hit by everything else the enemies have to offer.  I could only think that in today's meta, he would only be very successful if he were paired with Odin and Phantom were removed.  I think old Vulcan's kit in its original form is just too problematic to synergise with other gods or even itself. He would need some drastic reimaginings to keep him a blacksmith-esque character. I also don't think that a guardian would work with blacksmith kits unless it were a mech stance switch thing or something.  They could start by making turrets cheaper, weaker in health and only alive for a certain amount of time (like only a couple seconds). This would make killing them a risky investment without AOE spells. Maybe they could work like Clash's phoenixes with beam projectiles? They could reintroduce the Thumper in similar capacity. Since his damage would be limited, they could make him more auto attack focused so he isn't terrible on the damage front. For CC, perhaps the Thumper could put stacks on, if enemies were hit with X amount of stacks, they could get stunned or mezzed.

I actually think the same about Mareczko. He seems to clinb even worse than Kittel.
That movie opened up hitting hard and just never let up!  The sequence that always stands out in my mind is when Mama unloads on the entire level with the chain gun. In a movie that was replete with violence, showing this awful woman and her henchmen annihilating an entire level of families and children just in the hopes of getting *two* adversaries was the ultimate in savagery. She was sadistic elsewhere (like how she tortured her tech guy) and the film was gruesome in other places (slo-mo hits before being thrown off of buildings) but for wanton savagery, that one did it for me.

If you're empty, with no load assigned, you can drive off-duty (personal conveyance) with your trailer. Just make sure to get your logs updated before you certify them.   If you have a reload already assigbed, you can legally drive, as long as you're empty and driving away from your upcoming shipper.

Shouldn't have written 16 episodes of filler shit then and only a handful of decent episodes then with the delusional expectation another series was assured. Shouldn't have not paid off why Lucifer got his wings back and lost his devil face. Shouldn't have made the Sinnerman arc cop out early and then have a dumb twist. Shouldn't have even wrote the Linda/Amenandiel/Maze bullshit in, shouldn't have turned Earth's Original Evil turned Crime Boss turned Evil Grooming Stepdad turned Top Dignitas Candidate, shouldn't have added a second love triangle between Cain/Lucifer/Dekker, shouldn't have made Ella so annoying, shouldn't have minimised Trixie and Dan, shouldn't have told folks in an interview they'd delay the reveal indefinitely... they fucked themselves by making the show into something else nobody wanted to see anymore.
He is a PROSECUTER!! Hint.   Hint.   Hint!
>he has stuck it out and not bitched and moaned about game time  That's a very, very flattering retelling of the last year of his career. He's only back at the club because he hurt his ACL while on loan, he's got nothing to threaten anyone with, Liverpool would *like* him to leave, he just can't.   Anyway, this whole post is a Bogdan meme, whether you realise it or not. Let's re-sign Anthony Le Tallec for one last hurrah too, maybe get Nigel Clough to step in and manage a game (only against lower-league opposition!) for sentiment's sake.   Stop this, guys. Let go. He's a meme because he seems like a decent guy who isn't really good enough to be anything else.
One who thinks the rest of the world should tread carefully not to offend him.  One who thinks his feelings come before facts.   One who feels entitled to respect even though he hasn't actually achieved shit. Doesn't understand hard work and real pain.  One who thinks he can rewrite ancient codes like gender roles because he's a feminist and scared/offended at the idea of holding his family down like he's supposed to.   One who writes off other guys as douchebags for doing natural male things like sports and hitting on women.  These are just a few but it's really an endless list. Honestly it's what they lack, confidence in themselves and their capabilities and pride in what they are. Their satisfaction doesn't come from within, it comes from the approval of others.

Some dude posted about his band in here called As Time Fades and they just put out a six-song EP called Growing Season and it is DOPE as fuck.

Dangit, when I was in RCIA I never had this much swag.
>But it was also the year that JKR publicly said, in front of the same young children who read the books, that Dumbledore was gay, amounting to the same media blitz that would have happened if it had been said directly in the books and the same readers being aware of his sexuality, and therefore if this was indeed JKR's or the editor's objective, then I don't understand why it's not okay to say in the books but is okay to say on the book's highly publicized tour.  I think that Dumbledore being confirmed as gay in the book would have resulted in a much bigger controversy. First of all, the reach of the books is way more than a reading. Yes, the news was covered by major outlet and is there on the net but it's not the same and is easily lost unless one is looking for info on Albus or homosexuality in the series. My friend, who is a fan of the series, only knew about Albus being gay when the second FBAWTFT was announced. (I was lowkey disappointed in her. >.< ) Second, the reading was done in a Western country. Yes, it was controversial but it was still manageable. Can you imagine the reaction of more traditional countries where their children were being exposed to homosexuality? (Oh, the horror!) Third, there's Death of the Author. By excluding the info from the book, it allows the reader to disregard Dumbledore's homosexuality as additional info, or worse, as merely a projection of JKR political stance (I have read this so many times that I can't even...)   So, I can see why she opted for a 'as you like it' approach. Otherwise, it would have compromised or even overshadowed the release of the last book of the series. It was a sad but necessary decision.  Have **4 Credit OWLs** for this great comment. I really like the 'catch-22' when it comes to fans reaction about Dumbledore.
You can apply to whatever school you want, but your zone school has to take you. A lot of kids just stay in their zone school because that’s where a lot of your friends from your neighborhood wind up going, but many others go to specialized schools or private schools.   Practically speaking, most kids go where their parents want them to go, or at least a school their parents are okay with.

I'd been through a bad break up and sworn off dating, my friend convinced me to try Tinder one last time. Met a guy whos picture was so hot I immediately assumed he was fake. He called me and made me laugh like a drain, turns out he was a previously overweight dude with thyroid issues who ended up being a personal trainer, he sees me for who I am and couldn't give a shit aboit my body, we're getting married this summer.  Never think that you won't find 'the one'. Sometimes he's the last person you expect to meet, but the best person for you.

Indeed. Our evolutionary advantage as humans is our superior brain power. We aren't stronger or faster than most larger species out there. What we do have is a much better brain. We can *outthink* any potential predators. I feel that the natural course for human evolution will be the fusion of man and machine.

The devs really, really need to make sure the base content is competitive or people will resent having to pay for it. They are adding Oversky to the base set and allowing you to play the missions one by one which is a great start since there are a lot of powerful cards in that set. Base commons are pretty strong too. Content from world bosses + puzzles/solo content + base set + oversky + gauranteed legendary/epic crafts every 12 hrs seems like tonnes of content (depending on the price point). Also worth pointing out you get all the stuff I mentioned without doing PVP so the devs should be able to make it so you can get to a competitive point, skill and card wise, without having to vs people and get crushed.  I agree with you on the point about the deluxe account. Even if whatever Abrakam do with it is a fair system it's a concept people are going to *hate*. Min/maxing rewards based on time (e.g. daily quests/12 hr crafts) is also questionable. On top of the points you raised maximising rewards while minimising play time means logging in every 24hrs, completing your quest, crafting a card and logging off. Lots of upfront rewards encourages you to keep logging in but it won't encourage you to play a lot which is bad for player numbers. Obviously you also don't want to force people to grind but making it an option is important. In todays market where F2P is the expectation it's a difficult balancing act for sure.

Those two statements are not mutually exclusive, which means one being true does not make the other false.  It's entirely possible (and likely) that the GMS2 CBT has the same experience rates as the other versions of the game, but is going to be reduced when the game is released.

Pretty much everything should work on classic so don't worry about it. Don't worry about speech checks either. Just pick what you like. Don't stress about what's optimal because you'll be stuck re\-rolling new characters constantly and you'll end up hating the game \(that damn unskippable prologue;P\) before you even start playing it.   From what you wrote so far it looks like you really want to play cipher so go for it. Yes, you can pair him with a Fighter. Inquisitor will probably be an even better option so if you found a build for it on the Obsidian forum just follow it and enjoy the game :\)
Awooo~!
Never played any besides 0 and 4, but Yakuza 0 pretty much ended with Majima meeting Kiryu for the first time, so having a 0 part 2 would only make sense for Kiryu to be in it, whether Majima is the only playable character or not. Also, having Majima be playable but not Kiryu if he was in it would kinda suck to be honest.

Not just him though, Martinez laid the foundations and Sousa/Jackett deserve some credit too. We had a decade-long run of smart, well-planned managerial appointments supplemented by intelligent player recruitment, but since Garry Monk, it's been short-term managerial panic-hirings and sloppy, scattergun signings. It's like desperation worked once, so that's just how we live now.

Unfortunately, the S7 does not support USB to c ethernet passthrough tethering with GearVR. The GearVR puts the S7 into "slave" mode. As such S7 will not work with USB passthrough. You would need an S8 or better. However, if you want the tethering and are willing to give up the extra head tracking the GearVR adds, then do an Lshaped micro usb to usb and tether that way. I can send you a link to show how someone did it. The S7 has a built in gyro scope so you will still have headtracking, just not as advanced.

Smart casual at the office, with dress-down Fridays (jeans and trainers, even sandals if the weather permits). Rule is to not show too much skin, I guess.   Oh, if we’re meeting clients, formal is the rule.  I wear a little bit of makeup everyday, so that makes no difference to me. A colleague also told me there was an unwritten rule about women wearing heels when meeting clients, but that seems to have gone away quietly.

They're put in Ponderosa in pregame, but no one is allowed to speak to each other. They talk to the staff, make eye contact, and annoy the shit out of each other, but that's about all they're allowed to do in terms of contact.   Pre-merge Ponderosa is the same as the post-merge. Once the jury begins, they fly out the pre-mergers to a set vacation spot, where they spend the rest of the 18 or so days in that location.   My guess is that they just don't have enough space for everyone to be in the same location, but I couldn't tell you why they fly out the pre-mergers separately. The entire cast obviously talks, but I guess it also has more to do with the fact that the pre-mergers don't have a final say in who wins and production probably doesn't want anyone accidentally meddling with the votes.

Apollyon is 6'1 and is taller than the normal Warden by what looks like a few inches (from the scene where Warden and Apollyon are talking before raiding the viking village). Centurion is probably also 6'1, or maybe slightly shorter, since he is also slightly taller than the regular Warden.  Everyone is shorter than they look because Apollyon is 6'1 and it makes me sad. I always entertained Shugoki being a 7 ft. monster :(

Honest question: How would mentioning somebody’s nationality increase karma? Do you think being Korean is a shameful thing to be sympathized with? It’s not like an illness, or something else unfortunate, that somebody might disgracefully capitalize on for sympathy. It’s where that person is from. If I had a kid, and that kid’s great grandparents came straight from Ireland (my family is of Irish descent so that’s why I chose Ireland as my hypothetical example), I may throw in that tidbit if I was sharing about the generations in my family. I don’t see the issue with mentioning it. However, downvotes I’m ready for you.
Can someone help me understand this. I see more negative effects of making “propaganda” illegal because who decides what is and what isn’t “propaganda.” Do we want to live in a world where Dems can ban Fox News and Veritas and Judicial Watch for being “propaganda.” I think we would be better off expanding the ability of people/companies to sue the media when they are slandered.

FOOLISH INSECTS. IT'S CLEARLY A JIGGLYPUFF AS SEEN FROM ABOVE.
  Chelsea players were left bemused by head coach Antonio Conte’s decision to make six changes for their must-win game against Huddersfield Town. And the feeling in the squad is that Conte blew any remote chance of forcing Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich into keeping him at Stamford Bridge.  Chelsea’s 1-1 draw against Huddersfield, which secured the Terriers’ Premier League status, left the Blues needing a final-day miracle to climb above Liverpool into the top four. They are now on course for a first-ever full Europa League campaign.  While there was an acceptance Chelsea were unfortunate not to win after dominating the game, there were also questions raised over Conte’s selection. The Italian started with Chelsea’s in-form players, Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard, on the substitutes’ bench, with Victor Moses, captain Gary Cahill and Tiemoue Bakayoko also stepping down.  Conte blamed the omission of Thibuat Courtois on a minor back injury, but it is understood the Belgian was unlikely to play in any case. Willy Caballero took over and was partly at fault for Laurent Depoitre’s goal for the visitors.  After the draw, Conte defended his rotation but some players believe he blundered by making so many changes and were shocked when the line-up was announced prior to the game. Needing two victories to put maximum pressure on Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, the expectation within the squad was that there would only be minor changes for the Huddersfield game. Antonio Conte looks bemused Antonio Conte looks bemused Credit: AFP  One source questioned whether or not Barcelona or Real Madrid would rest either Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo if they were in Chelsea’s position. It is believed several of the players rested for the Huddersfield game wanted to play and felt physically ready to.  The draw is likely to have been Conte’s final game in charge of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, although a run of five successive wins before the Huddersfield game had sparked some new debate over whether or not the 48 year-old should be retained.     The overriding feeling among the players is that a new head coach will be in charge next season and that Conte killed any chance of a rethink by making so many changes. Asked if he had picked his team with one eye on the FA Cup final against Manchester United, Conte said: “Absolutely. I did the rotation also against Burnley. To make rotation, it means playing with players like Morata, Willian and Christensen, players who usually are in the line-up from the start.  “It's stupid if we think rotation was a problem. We are Chelsea. We have a big squad and players who can play the whole game, but they must win. At Burnley we won the rotation was good. We spent a lot of energy against Liverpool. People said that line-up was not good, but we won. This is football.”

I suppose it depends on what people want to make, I used a rail end and sledge hammer as my anvil for a while when i started but i also started on small projects. If you want to make a long knife on it's side is certainly better. I also ground some radius including a fuller and a cutoff into the web of the on end rail which was a nice feature, and a lot less cuttoff wheels than the horns people often grind into rails on their side.

The exact same thing happened to me the other night. I threw my smoke signal and it bounced/rolled right under the tunnel just barely. I was so mad at myself.  I ended up using it as a lure/trap though and I got a double kill so I guess it wasn’t entirely bad.   My all time favorite is on Shipment when someone spawns in front of you while you’re throwing the signal (which causes it to bounce back inside the crate 😩)

Grief does fucked up things to people. I flew home from my brother's funeral, broke up with a BF of two years and the next week was banging some younger hot but brainless person because I couldn't handle having actual feelings for anything or anyone. I thought I was "living again" and it ended up being one of the darker, more cringey times in my life. I was 21, though and he's 39. He's a grown ass man who should have at least basic manners, and that doesn't include casual mention of buggering off to start a new life in front of the person you've shared yours with for nearly a decade.   If he's willing to throw you away like that and BE SO RUDE ABOUT IT, he doesn't deserve another thought. Don't do his laundry, make his dinner or anything\- he wants to be single, let him try it on for size. As big of a trope as we make about men being commitment\-phobic, they LOVE knowing someone who cares about them and their needs is there. He feels safe saying that crap because he knows you're not going anywhere.   That said, he is being a massive c\*nt to you and I wouldn't stand for it. Two options here\- either he sees a counselor before making any more impulsive/mean plans, or you disengage and prepare to split. You need to make sure you can take care of you and let him do whatever he wants. Sounds like this means working more hours and not spending money at events or whatever activities y'all had planned.
i own the season pass, and its not hard to find a game in tdm and sometimes when they run special playlists thats not hard to find a playlist. they put those out to promote people playing stuff other that TDM all the time which is mostly what pc players play.
Omg 😮 how did it feel?! He’s massive!
There’s a piece of art I saw once that I would really love to know more about. Didn’t have a credited artist, no name, just looked like oatmeal vomit.  I don’t get it.
/u/TristanwithaT is saying that the debt on the Old Navy card isn't just Old Navy clothes, since it's a Visa that can be used anywhere.
Controversial opinion: I think I enjoy Doolittle's post-game interviews a bit better than Papelbon's.
Please 😁
I wish they'd bring Vergne back, he was really close to Ricciardo
Rudy Giuliani’s emphatic defense of Donald Trump has included saying that Michael Cohen’s payoffs to Trump mistresses are completely standard operating procedure for lawyers. “That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds,” Giuliani said on Fox News … “Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of this with my clients.”
What game had the cast majority of those, I’m thinking it was Madden 06 but I was 5 when that game came out and while I played the crap out of it and remember some I’m not sure cuz I was young.
FUCK  YEAHHHH
Very expensive as a wingback.
He makes stupid mostly-fun action bullshit fests that exist to show off his wife and entertain drunk people. Which is cool, fair enough. He makes a stupid amount of money doing it. I’d probably even be into it—if he didn’t have to keep destroying beloved franchises to do it! Every time he makes a completely unrelated video game “adaptation” means another chance wasted of us actually getting a decent adaptation for that game series.
Bluahahaha
Can't find any definitions other thsn yours that say anything about income ratios.
Woodstock happened 49 years ago my man. At least update the title when you're nicking content.
Columns UI allows you to add and move around all kinds of extra panels that don't come with the default interface and make in-line tag edits, among other things.  There's dozens of panels included with Columns that don't require extra components including waveform analyzers, panels for artwork, tags/lyrics, stacks of tabs to keep foobar minimalist, etc.
I guess this card solely exists for 0 cost/spinning top/dropkick style decks and it’s main boon is the AOE aspect and that it helps with spiny guys.  I dunno. I don’t mind some situational stuff.
Hekk yeah
I deleted this post because I didn’t realize it was a repost. I jumped the gun a little when I saw an insane former classmate post this screenshot on Facebook agreeing with it.   Like most people, I subscribe to dozens of subreddits and miss things sometimes. Should’ve checked the recent posts before posting, but I was at work on break on mobile and just jumped the gun. Sorry about that!
No you don’t
That doesn’t mean it’s okay
I've consistently used Mudkip in both of my Hoenn playthroughs because I'm apparently incapable of handling anything else XD
I’d say incredibly unlikely. People like that can’t just up and change their style that drastically. If they could, they would.
So Yui is out of the band??? Well, now I know how bad all those teenage girls felt when their favorite boy bands broke up... It's devastating. *Sigh* Nothing last forever and time to move on. RIP BABYMETAL
I remembemy friends telling me how a bad idea it was, but when i tried it, it helped so much in a weird way. It al got kind of "funky", everything was just super funny ad goofy
Heh, I've taken to doing Kirin with Teostra hunting horn just to stick the divine blessing and debuff immunities on everyone :p  Even then it's sometimes not enough :O
That’s just creepy
It's obvious that So6p version of both is meant
Living for this pallete! My fave shades have to be Lala, Carolyn and Chad because they’re good matte blues and greens and they aren’t black based ❤️ and they match up with the shimmer blue and greens in the Saint and Sinner pallete. The colours are all crazy creamy but especially the shimmers leafar, Kelly and Egypt are my fave shimmers!
I love the style and arts as well as the monster and armor and weapon designs in Generations.  I actually hope that they continue the more fanciful aspects on the Switch while World sticks to the more realistic aspects.  I also notice that on one hand we have people saying MHGU is going to be tough for players that only know World due to the QoL and other changes. That it will be too difficult compared to World.  On the other hand there are people saying Generations with the styles and arts makes it too easy.  I hope people just give it a chance and try not to judge it compared to World since in many ways there's no way it can live up to a game that came after it.  But in many ways it has its own charming and fun aspects.
There are a ridiculous number of birth control options (essentially, anything hormone-based) that also carry the possibility of weight gain. Your gf should see a doctor, and possibly look into other forms of birth control that are not hormone-based if that is the root of her weight gain.
Honestly don't think the two albums are very similar at all, though I'm just starting my 2nd listen of TBH+C now
TIL there’s wheat in dianabol
Lmao facts just waiting for a legendary skin that i actually like
No dota2 or csgo?? Sad :(
You look like a talentless, uninteresting, unintelligent Greg Proops.
Yes you can, you create macros for the spells using /lunamo (whatever spell)
You were downvoted but isn't decarbed THC (like what you'd have in an edible) poisonous to (most?) animals? As far as I knew they could digest it as long as it wasn't decarbed because their bodies do something differently but if you decarb it then give it to them it's poison.
HEYYYYO
FINAL PROOF THAT THE LEFT CAN’T ~~MEME~~ MAKE EROTICA! /s
Yeah desoxyn is alright if you have no tolerance but 5mg is nothing, good d isomer heavy crystal meth beats it any day...now if they had like 25 mg or 50 mg desoxyn it’d be a different story...
oh I didn‘t mean gatorade I meant that frozen orange juice thing
Aight, doesn't matter that much anyway, I just got a bit worried when seeing that hehe
A lot of diseases require us to make decisions involving animals unwillingly. Not even testing, but if you view tranquilizing an animal, gathering blood samples or a few to take to a lab as un-vegan, a lot of nasty things can cause harm to animals and humans into perpetuity.   I'm for animal testing, but not for shampoos and lipstick and what nots.  Otherwise, shoes are a big thing for me. I have big feet and can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars just for a pair of sneakers that, according to a lot of customers, will fall apart after 5 months.
You are stupid and your family and country are bad. It's not my job to back it up lmfao.
You’re absolutely right! It’s crazy that they’re SOOO cool and no one even knows they exist.

I have chrome but it doesn’t show so what’s the point
two months ago, i quit smoking cigarettes after a decade of the disgusting habit. haven't touched one since, i've worked out every single day \(to the point i hurt myself lol\), i've went from 130lbs \(58 kg\) to 150lbs \(68kg\) and most importantly i feel so much better about myself
Is anyone else miffed that he typed “a” major instead of “A” major?
Ehh it depends on who you got the loan from so make sure you always read the terms. In my case NJCLASS in NJ is the biggest loaner to students after FASFA and up till 2017 the student debt was undischargable even in death. Took social media and a student being killed to change it. Beforehand they would garnish the parents wages. I assume if the parents died as well they sell the next of kin and see if they'll pay even though they have no legal obligation to do so.
luke being out let you abuse them up the middle, which is easily the weakest part of the roosters game  hard to say what would have changed if luke was playing but I would expect a much more grindy game
Thank you for the advice. I’m well aware of the grid method. To be honest printing is expensive since the ink is like 60 bucks and most printers won’t work with even one colour missing. So I’ll have to maybe find a grid thing online to place over an image and do it like that.
I downloaded a few. I think ibm QISK, and Pyquil not from pypi but direct from ibm and pyquil
I think the government and institutions did run experiments on humans in previous decades, but I’m not sure First Nations were specified in policy directives. The poor, unemployed, military people, were potential subjects.
No. I'm basing it off what I've seen of Bellerin over several years. When our attack has had its spacing and pace down, and we hit him on the overlap at the right times, he's been very dangerous. I expect to see that *again* as we sort out our attacking structure.
Bolt vs gas. Pic ur preference, both great rifles. You may want to look at Qindham Weaponry if you want a gas gun. Waaaaay better shooter than the MP10.
I agree with you mostly here, but is the last sentence implying that the only reason any black people don’t speak AAVE is because they’re pressured not to?
Haven’t seen *The Wire* yet... still have to check it out...
I'm so conflicted. I want to see a Jets/VGK West final but I also don't want one of them to go home.
Oh my. TWO! HRs given up by your closer. That’s unheard of as is 1-3 records by your closer.   Neris needs to go.
Or use Strava heatmaps..
Wow! ❤
Hear me out here... How much of the league would be pissed off and ready to burn things at a Tampa-Vegas final?
agree. thats what I am trying to say. perhaps you wanted to reply to the guy
I’m mean that’s happened to me before
> So that would be 4 dies with 2 cores on each die? (aka 6 cores disabled on each die?!)  Yes and 8 cores per DIE * 4 DIES and you have the 32 core top model.   Threadripper might be your best bet but there are only 10 Mainboards for Threadripper (TR4 socket)
That’s fair enough.
How big are your hands?  If you have small hands, Roccat KPOE is pretty solid.  If medium, Finalmouse Ergo 2 if you can find one.  I would give the G403/G703 a try like you mentioned.  It's readily available and built better than the Ergo 2.
I wouldn’t quite say I hate tableau, but damn if I don’t agree with you on the rest. I have aggregation calculations happening in a Google Sheet because I can’t figure out how to do what I need in Tableau. It’s absurd.

Spyro: ETD has the BEST music in any Spyro game IMO.  Top Tracks: Oasis Speedway, Banzai Speedway, Cloud 9, Thieves Den, Peaceful Ice Slider, Monkey Monastery.  (srsly, all of these would be in my top 20 Spyro tracks)  Worst Tracks: Crop Circle Country
I sense your concerns.  In my view, there are two dynamics that needs to be understood correctly in order to move ahead and progress, in any similar undertaking. That is, when God's will is involved, or an undertaking that upholds the will of the Creator.  1. Division Type #1 - to advance his work, God needs to divide good from evil. Evil must be exposed, cleansed out, and removed. This is so that the individual, group, agents, etc., advancing good can move forward unhampered.  Response Method: Support. Cleanse out falsehood and evil.  2. Division Type #2 - this kind of division is fostered by evil. It attacks the camp of good, to create division, conflict, and distraction. The purpose: to undermine the aims of good.  Response method: Reject. Bind together in unity centering on goodness, truth.   It takes skill and awareness to be able to distinguish between these two types of division.   If you are looking for scriptural clarification of this notion, note the words of Jesus:  Division Type #1: Matt. 10:34 ""Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword." Division Type #2: Ephesians 2:14 "For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility.."  Division Type #1 occurs so that God alone, or good alone, may be sovereign. Goodness cannot dwell when there are two masters being served Matt 6:24 "No one can serve two masters...."  The situation we currently have here is Corsi, Alex Jones, and Others asserting themselves as 'masters', as the center, as those who can and should define what is true regarding Q. And, in recent days and weeks, they have exposed themselves to say, "trust us, not Q". That's the center of this issue.   The course of action then is to choose one master. You cannot follow both Q and Jerome Corsi. Sorry, to suggest a tone of religious devotion, but you know what I mean. If you believe and trust in Q, you cannot believe and trust ion Corsi, et al. Two contradictory masters. You must divide yourself - go with one or the other. Not both.   Division Type #2 is when evil seeks to promote itself as a new master to those seeking to follow good. It attempts to create confusion. If you feel confusion, its a good signal that this is a Division Type #2 scenario, and you should respond accordingly. Find the one center, and unite with that.   Notice how the Left always seeks to promote unity over truth? Ignore the truth, just be united. Emotional comfort. Why does the radicalized Left promote this? It creates confusion, confuses the center, and allows greater infiltration and obscuring of the truth. The Radical Left feed on lies, and seek to manipulate the masses through lies. This is the hallmark of evil.   I hope this offers some help, or at least comfort.   A few days ago, I wanted to believe that Jones and to a lesser extend Corsi, were both motivated by essentially good motives, just flawed in their characters, egos, etc. As we are all susceptible to this. Recent developments show clearly, this is not the case.   Q IS about divisiveness. Have you not been watching? But its Divisiveness Type #1: about seeing where and what evil really is, how it is working, and about cleansing it out from our systems, our networks, our world. THAT's where unity comes from. From clarifying the good from the bad, the evil. The light of truth.   Therefore, as we move forward, the progress will NECESSARILY involve certain, painful, and challenging moments. Q and the great awakening are about to go mainstream bigtime! BIGLY!   Therefore, this current chaos and upheaval - its par for the course. Strap in. We are ALL moving towards to victory. Steel your heart to digest what comes up, and keep the faith.   What is a patriot?   WWG1WGA.   Cheerio.
Only the guild wars 2 community could be self-centered enough to post passive aggressive "reminders" requesting having damage to overheal show up in a different color. Jesus.
'Sweet Dreams' is a thriller music video by Tan Daze, being inspired from Marilyn Manson's video. It is out on 18th this month!! :) <3 Here's a glimpse of what you are going to watch #sweetdreams #trailer #musicvideo #18thmay #release #tandaze
Even 36 would be hard to believe. I’m clueless 🤷🏼‍♂️
when i said nature i meant ability lolol my bad. All mine are adamant. But I'll send you one with HA its 5IV

Doesn’t matter. He’s huge, he makes albums ffs. Has plenty of boiler rooms and sets with thousand and millions of views. Koze is not indie.
Darren seems to have a source at Colney specifically, which is why he often gets stuff right in terms of injuries and small details.  Bigger things like transfers and contracts he's just spouting rumours.
Yep! My dog is happy to see everyone, my cat happy to see no one, but my rabbit (sadly no longer on this earth) was happy to see *people she knew*. You could really obviously tell who she knew or didn't know - like at parties she would hop into the laps of her friends, maybe once in a while nudge the foot of someone she'd met a couple of times, and straight-up ignore strangers. Absolutely hilarious. She knew more tricks and commands than my dog, and played several little games like tug and fetch. Just a delightful creature all around! A lot of personality in a very little package.  But having hay everywhere, making sure her diet had the right balance of veggies, making sure she wasn't going into stasis, grooming her, cleaning up after flyaway poops that rocket away mid-binky, providing the right chewing toys, keeping all cords but especially Apple cords away from her, never setting food down where she could get it, never leaving books or papers out, etc were really just much much more intensive than even my high-energy dog.
Dude, just stop! She’s 7 if you wanted her to stop, you could. Don’t make excuses for your behavior. And especially don’t do it by blaming her! Half the things you talked about could have been prevented because you’re an adult... and she’s 7! And maybe not sexualizing a 7 year old girl is a great place to start
Starlin looks like he eats booty.
I mean it sounds like he’s fine with that
We Basscon warriors don't bite TOO hard...
I can’t unsee this now!
Maybe just busy? Which isn’t a bad thing. My husband also talks for  living - he kind of wants to hibernate away from work which makes what we do a challenge at times. but it’s good to be wanted.  (And respectabullinma...can have that affect on people ;-) )
I said this before knowing he was in his early 20s but…They probably just wanted to fuck regardless of her meaningless high school math grades.  Now that I know he was that young, I'm sure they just wanted to fuck.   17-23, those are both kids.
