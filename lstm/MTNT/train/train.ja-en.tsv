1315	25歳前後で｢早婚する女子｣たちの実態と本音 | さとり世代は日本を救うか？ | 東洋経済オンライン  (条件の)いい女から先にどんどん売れていくのは、ここ15年くらいの特徴なんじゃない   女視点から見ても(結婚するのに都合が)いい男は売れているのかもしれない    さっさと結婚して、会社とかラボに在籍したまま子育てして上手いことやってるイメージ	The actual state, condition, and feelings of women before and after 25 years old who were married young. | Will the Satori generation save Japan? | Tokyo Keizai Online Aren't those the qualities that have been gradually passing for a desirable woman for the past 15 years? It's the image of getting married quickly and raising children well while working or being enrolled in a lab.
2132	25歳前後で｢早婚する女子｣たちの実態と本音 | さとり世代は日本を救うか？ | 東洋経済オンライン  おっそ、要らない人間だから晩婚のすすめされてるのわかんねのかな   どうせこの一行じゃ通じないんだろうけれどな	The conditions and motivations of "girls married young" around the age of 25 | Will the Satori Generation save Japan? | Toyo Keizai Online. They are unnecessary people, so maybe they don't know that a late marriage is recommended. At any rate the idea won't get through to them.

524	2ちゃんねる用語「20年目」の今 消えた「逝ってよし」「オマエモナー」、定着した「神」  2ch(5ch)の口調って大きく変遷してるよな、つい最近まで猛虎弁、今はそれも廃れて絵文字とか、そんな感じに…	2chan "20 year old" terminology that has now disappeared, the "gods" that became entrenched, "You may go" "You too, huh"  The tone of 2ch (5ch) has changed so much, until recently it was the Hanshin Tigers dialect, now that's all obsolete and it's emojis and the like, that kind of feeling...
3321	2ちゃんねる用語「20年目」の今 消えた「逝ってよし」「オマエモナー」、定着した「神」  もう5chだし若者から見たら古臭い 今でも専門板なりマイナーな板だと草生やしたりする人いるから用語が主流のその時若者だった人達はワザと使いそう	Current 2channel terminology in it's "20th year". "Go ahead and die" and "you too" have disappeared, "God" has become established. It's 5ch now, and from younger people these are old too. Even now on technical bulletin boards and minor bulletin boards there are people who "grow grass." People who were young when that terminology was popular might be using them on purpose.

"Executive of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism" is apprehensive. If you're interested go to the Chisan Mansions in Nagoya. Apparently they're still going strong.
4321	30歳契約社員「ギャンブルは性に合わないのでコインチェックで200万円買った」  ２００万を1億5千万まで握れる時点でたいしたものだとは思うが   実質２００万の損ならまだ先はあるし   全額でないにしろ返金される可能性もまだあるわけだし	30 year old contract employee: "Gambling does not suit my personality so I bought 2 million yen on Coincheck". I think the point where you turn 2 million into 150 million is a great feat, but there's still a future ahead if you lose an actual 2 million. And there's still a possibility that you'll get a refund even if it's not all the money.
2152	30歳契約社員「ギャンブルは性に合わないのでコインチェックで200万円買った」  上場廃止の整理銘柄指定なら９９勝１敗で負けるパターンだけど   暴落予想はできてもいつでも利確できる値段だし   口座ロックまでは予想出来なかったか	30 year old contract employee "Gambling doesn't really suit me, so I bought 2 million yen worth on coincheck." If it were about stocks being delisted then then it'd be a 99 win 1 loss losing pattern, but even if you predict a sudden crash it's always at a price sure to be profitable, and you couldn't have predicted the lock on the account, right?
3206	30歳契約社員「ギャンブルは性に合わないのでコインチェックで200万円買った」  そうだよ（便乗）   お絵かきレベルのサポートライン引くだけでボラ大きいと利益出まくるわ    ところで日経平均株価が数%動いただけで大騒ぎになるってマジ？   そんなんビットコインだったら1時間で落ちるから笑うわ。しかも毎日やぞ	30 year old contract employee "I'm not into gambling, so I put 2 million yen into coincheck". Yeah (jumping on the bandwagon). Just with a support line at the hand drawn level the high volatility can make for huge profits. By the way, is it true that there is a big commotion just because the Nikkei Stock Average moved by a few percent? If it were bitcoin then in an hour it'd fall, so it makes you laugh. And it is like that everyday.

It's like a feeling of speechlessness when a lot of people die. It accumulates somewhere deep in your heart and stays there. It's like your legs aren't steady. Personally I think the 3/11 earthquake also played a part in strengthening the conservative feelings.

Students only would be too modest. After stepping into the mid 20s, people start having there own obsessions, talking about work and income with each other, so they just can't party anymore.

3466	はれのひ、3億2000万円の債務超過だった（東京商工リサーチ）  酷い話だと思うが正直クソほどどうでもいい 憤る人にはちゃんと話合わせて酷いね！！してるけどクソほどどうでもいい	On a rather formal occasion, there was an insolvency of 320 million yen (Tokyo Commerce research).  I think it's a terrible story but I honestly don't care.  For those that are hurt by it I will talk and say, "that's terrible!" but honestly I don't care.

First person adventure that paints a delicate picture of human relations over a transceiver. The developer immediately put it on PS4, so I was thinking it was probably a timed exclusive.

PreCure is amazing. I don't know much about other Toei works, but in the case of PreCure, it feels like depending on the year and the episode things are scattered. From the start with season 1 through season 3 or 4 things would come to a close at the end of a season with 12 or 24 episodes in pretty standard fashion. But with each passing year the overall quality improves, and recently even aside from those wrapups the image quality is good and they are well produced, and as far as years go there are some years where they keep the quality high without missing a beat. I am filled with expectation hoping that this is one of those years.

Basically it is a purpose to promote the transition to an expensive upper plan by deteriorating existing plan.

What comes It is absolutely better to rotate the real work than to tie it different ones  that I probably do not take to play.

713	PS4とVR買ってしまった  格子感は確かにほぼ気づかなかったし追跡の喪失も全然なかった。そこは良かったかもしれない。ただ頭振った時に2D変形補完がぐねぐねしてるのが結構はっきり見えて萎える   ViveのLighthouseも最低距離がないから一旦置いちゃえば問題ないし、むしろMSのトラッカーが活きてくるのは家単位の追跡かもしれない  アキヨドで体験してよかったらSNSで広めてくださいって言われたけど、VRは第一印象が完璧であるべきってPalmerの言い方を考えるとあんまり勧められないなぁ	I bought a PS4 and a VR.  I didn't notice the lattice effect, and there was no loss in tracking ability.  So overall pretty good.  But I shook my head over the clearly visible wavering from the 2D transformation supplementation.  Vive's Lighthouse also doesn't have the shortest distance, which is not a problem if just placed briefly. \\nRather, the reason why the MS tracker becomes active could be because it tracks at the house level.\\nI have heard that if you have had a good experience with the Akiyo, you can ask for it to be widened on social media, but when I think of Palmer's Maxim that VR should be perfect, then I can't recommend it.

I wish they'd turn a bit of that attention to Konami. Well, even so to do anything with the V and PW it will be compulsory to spend time. Like how just a bit ago phone games tried to stretch out their main content, and compared with ratio business from the the missing link scam, compared to PW... EA is always throwing gasoline on the fire, and they are bringing themselves down, and at the same pace as usual sales will continue and things will end with reviews of a mediocre game.

Japan's birthrate is too low, in the past six years adult diaper sales have passed those for baby diapers. r/todayilearned You are an idiot. No matter how hard many men work they can't even get their hands on sex robots, nobody would work hard in a hell like that. About 80% of the reason men work hard is to get sex, so there's no way that taking that away is a change for the better. Growth in the West is built on immigration and the exploitation of Asia, but those are almost at their limit. With Asian independence and a lack of sex being supplied to the losing males in the West, it will all end for real. The value of women will crash and women will work to support some men, but there's no way that can last so in the end it will mean ruin.

This was my first time reading a long piece from Lully. Taking results from America and international politics, and having a free discussion to try to confirm threats like North Korea and China... I guess that's the style she's using. It's just like how when a crackpot researcher explains aliens or UFOs they always bring up "NASA did..."

As always Ark uses last generation matchmaking and isn't being improved. Tekken hasn't been improved since the 7th generation arcade machine, and there's also that thing with character selection. Since 3 the household version has been continually getting worse. There are still rumors that the developers and top players are in collusion. Capcom does have the most stable matchmaking, but they are trying to reproduce the arcade timed releases for household use, and while I personally do think it's interesting and tried it, other than that it's been neglected and left to die. In the end they just keep referencing back to EVO, and it feels like no matter how you choose there aren't any developers doing a great job. ~~ SEGA? Tecmo? SNK? Who knows ~~

Marine Corps says 37% of helicopters are ready for flight. No, the response was that of the weapons installed, it's standard for only 30% to be active. But 90% of fighters are online, and that's apparently the strength behind the US army and JSDF. That's what it said, at least. That's why in the first response it said that it wasn't helicopters. You should treat these as two separate issues. According to the original article, a liutenant general with the Marine Corps reported that the rate of online helicopters for the Marines is not more than 37%. So if you look at that reference, even though it's unclear to what extent that has decreased, you can clearly tell that for the Marines, it's now at a level too low to ignore. Simply put, it may be nothing more than a plea for an expanded budget.

3262	今日、ぼくが見た夢 : 俺は、通販サイトで食用の虎を1週間くらい買った。虎といっても、子供の虎で大きさは子猫くらいだった。虎は全て生きた状態で届き、食べるためには虎を屠殺するところから始めなければならなかった。マニュアル通り、虎の頭をタオルで包み、壁に何度も打ち付け殺す。子供とはいえ、獰猛な虎だ。俺は必死になって壁に打ち付けた。そして、殺したあと、そのまま虎を食べた。鶏肉のような味と、ぷりぷり、コリコリした独特の食感が美味しかった。  ゆう君の文章って心に響くわ	This is the dream that I had. I bought tigers to eat for about a week. Even though I say tiger, they were more like tiger cubs. They arrived alive and I needed to kill them first. I followed the instructions of the manual and wrapped a towel around their head. I then hit them against the wall several times killing them. They were very ferocious even though they were cubs. After I hit them against the wall rather aggressively, I ate them. They tasted like chicken and had a rather unique crispy taste. It was delicious. My heart vibrates when reading Yuu’s paragraph.

Although it was described as a tiger, it was just a baby, about the size of a kitten. The tiger was delivered alive, so I thought I had better slaughter it.  I looked at the manual and it told me to wrap the tiger's head in a towel and bash it against a wall several times to kill it. It was fierce for a baby.  I desperately kept bashing it against the wall.  When I had killed it, I ate it just as it was.  It was delicious; tender and crunchy, like chicken flesh.  Surplus energy.

I failed it right at the spot. Nah, I mean wasn't it obvious by looking at my papers? "IP business experience required" wasn't written in the ad, that's why I applied. If you have any mercy, reject me by my application. I took a day out of my busy work schedule just to go to this interview. Or should I say, it's the desperation of someone like me who left school, and only has work experience as a programmer, and such. Is it that they have a norm of interviewing a certain number of people every day?

Providing individual attention 24 hours a day 365 days a year for 200,000 yen per month, sexual harassment is a daily occurrence. This is tough... I wish they would make some welfare system changes addressing the number of people in charge, the care, the paid time off, etc. But as for the wages the base level is about the same in the US. Also, I think it'd be good to do one bath per week. It is too much of a burden on the caregivers, and for elderly people there is no real need for them to bathe all that often.

She commented, “it is a witch hunt,” “freedom of speech should be recognized,” “people are being instantly punished and losing their jobs for touching someone’s lap and trying to kiss him/her.” She defended men by saying they are losing their honor unfairly. However, those kind of men are a problem.

But handicaps are an odd convention, aren't they?

The substitute worker is like 'Thank you for your hard work.  I came and fixed things.  Until things are fixed, someone is pleading and someone else is coming to work.' Other members are like, 'the substitute came and couldn't use the surrounds, so lets go.  Me, 'I'm cool, but I need to do late night overtime in order to make sure everything is managed'.  If it was me, I would return.

182	バターの供給不足回避へ 新年度も１万3000トンの輸入枠  トラを走らせてバターにしよう（残虐	Coping with a shortage of butter: plan to import 13,000 tons next fiscal year. Have the tigers run until they turn into butter (how cruel)
3781	バターの供給不足回避へ 新年度も１万3000トンの輸入枠  酪農家の保護の為に農水省は補助金で、指定団体は生産量を制限して乳価を維持してるじゃん。これやってる以上何も変わらない  生乳の生産量は乳価が下がらないように毎年ギリギリに設定してるから予想外の需要増や供給減が発生したら作り置きができない。作り置きのシーズンは需要がひとめぐりする冬のみだから、足りない場合は輸入しないと作れないんですよ。余りを出したら乳価が下がるから乳牛酪農家が儲からない。けど乳価が維持されているから酪農家の収入は頭打ちで結局離農するから今の状況がある。  どーせバターは輸入品でも品質安定するから別に日本で加工しなくてもいいじゃんって発想になってるんじゃないか	Avoiding a butter shortage. Import ceiling of 13,000 tons for the new year. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issues subsidies for protection of dairy farmers, with production being restricted to selected entities to keep the price of milk steady. Doing this nothing will change. Every year the amount of milk produced is set to keep the price of milk just as it is, so if there is an unexpected rise in demand or fall in supply there is no way to make preparations. A season for making preparations is essential and it can only be during winter, so if there isn't enough it can't be produced without being imported. If there's extra then the price of milk will drop so dairy farmers won't make a profit. But the price of milk is kept steady, so the income for dairy farmers is being maxed out, and in the end they'll have no choice but to give up the profession. At any rate, even if butter is imported there are quality protections, so it seems like one thought is maybe it's fine if it isn't produced in Japan.

That's the tough situation. They released a new version that fixed the bug, but they said that the update is not compulsory

2164	冷静に考えたら職場で彼女作っても別れたり振られたりしたら気まずいし様々なリスクが伴うのでは？  使ったことないからわかんない、、  でもSNSで出会った例は知ってる  Twitterで同い年と思えるような発言(ポケモンのカスミが初恋だ〜、バトルアスリーテス大運動会観てた〜とか)してると、食いついてくるのがいるんよ  で、同い年のよしみで仲良く会話して、  初音ミクとかボカロとかの流行ってるコンテンツを通じてさらに仲良くなって、  おふざけでチャH(ま〇しょとする感じで、いや、向こうからしてくるからセクハラじゃないよ)してるうちに本気のチャHするようなって、お互い会おうって話になって、  DMで待ち合わせ場所決めて、、  そのまま普通にお付き合い。  まぁ、弟の話なんだけど、、  ちなみに、同い年かと思ってたら4歳年下で、  出会った時、弟大学の1年、相手中3、、みたいな感じだったらしい。  あまりにも同年齢ネタに食いつけるんで、出会うまで本気で同い年だと信じてたらしい。中身開けたら女子中学生だもんな、、  可愛くていい子だったよ。家事もしてくれてたし、、妹が嫉妬したのか気に食わなかったのか、メチャメチャにして別れさせてたけど、、	If you think about it rationally, even if you find a girlfriend at work, if you break up or get dumped it will be uncomfortable, and there are various risks, right? I've never used it so I don't know, but I know an example of meeting via SNS. There are cases where things come together with somebody who Tweets like they are around the same age (Misty from Pokemon was my first crush, I watched Battle Athletes, etc.). So being of similar age you start to talk and get closer, and through popular things like Hatsune Miku or Vocaloid you get even closer, then while kidding around with online sex (like saying, "Let's ***." Wait, it's coming from them so it's not sexual harassment) it becomes earnest online sex, and you both start talking about meeting up, so you settle on a place to meet through direct messaging, then you start dating. Well, for my younger brother, by the way, he thought they were the same age but she was actually four years younger, so when they met he was a freshman at college and she was a 9th grader, kind of like that. She seemed to be into things that you'd expect of somebody the same age, so until they actually met he thought they were the same age. When she opened up it turned out she was a 9th grader, a cute, good girl. She did chores at home, and maybe the little sister was jealous or unable to stomach things, so she ended up making a mess of things and breaking them up.

The phrases originate from a 1576 unpublished manuscript by George North. The title is somewhat misleading, as the main thrust of the article could be read to imply that the software could be used to find potential sources for use when plagiarizing. That being said, I do think it is true that there has traditionally been, in literature, the works of Shakespeare included, a strong interest in published works (and less interest in unpublished works or manuscripts).

The word English(eigo) is a language that people in [英国] speak, therefore it is called English.  英国 refers to England (England).  If we prompt the question as to why England came to be called 英国, it goes back to the Dutch language.  They called England 「Ingle」in Dutch, and Japanese people heard "Egeresu".  They matched that "E" sound with the Kanji character 「英（ei）」.  This is why English came to be called 「英語」.

I want to hope lol
3296	国会で昭恵に言及されると感情的になるあたり身内は相当大事にしていそう	People close to him are treated very importantly.
72	ここまでの国会答弁全部嘘だったことになるから、そら国会運営費数百億は無駄よ	If all of the answers in the Diet so far were lies, then the tens of billions of yen used in the Diet was completely wasted.

1584	国会 結局、若手が質問する訳でもなく 野党から奪った質問時間が余り過ぎて 時間つぶしの余興に励む 一太「応援してると、言って頂けますか？」 安倍「応援してる！」 一太「世耕大臣、いいじゃないか！と言って下さい」 世耕「いいじゃないか！」  全世界にこの酷芸の実態を	In the end, young people asking questions wasn't what was turning the National Diet into a side show of time killing; it was the political opposition stealing too much time that was set aside for questions. Ichita: "Can I get you to say 'I'm supportive'?" Abe: "I'm supportive!!!" Ichita: "Hiroshige Sekō, please say "It's fine, isn't it!" Sekō: "It's fine, isn't it!" The whole world can see through this horrible acting.

In the end, the younger ones can't ask questions. Too much question time stolen from opposing party, Ichita makes a show of wasting time "Would you say that you are rooting for it?" Abe "I am!" Ichita "Minister Sekou, please say, 'That's enough!'" Sekou "That's enough!" "Would you say you love me?" "I love you!" "Please say, 'Ore TUEEE!'" (I'm overwhelmed) "Ore TUEEE!" Is there an echo in here?
2974	国会 結局、若手が質問する訳でもなく 野党から奪った質問時間が余り過ぎて 時間つぶしの余興に励む 一太「応援してると、言って頂けますか？」 安倍「応援してる！」 一太「世耕大臣、いいじゃないか！と言って下さい」 世耕「いいじゃないか！」  税金ドロボーすぎんやろ	The Diet session ended before the young people could ask questions because of the opposite party taking too much time with questions. Trying to put on a time killing side show. Ichita: "Can I have you say you're supporting us?" Abe: "I'm supporting you!" Ichita: "Minister Seko, please say 'That's good!'" Seko: "That's good!" You're stealing too much tax dollars.

3323	「国民栄誉賞の価値は下がった。こんなに連発して」マツコの意見にネット賛否両論  金メダル(二連覇、66年ぶりの快挙)   んー。価値ないねぇ。	"The value of the People's Honor Award has gone down. So many have been awarded." The Internet is divided on Matsuko's opinion. Gold medal (two consecutive wins, hasn't been achieved for 66 years). Hmm. Doesn't have value.

Please give us a New Year's gift!" Making a list of investors who netted profits from ten million yen to several hundred million yen. Looking toward 2018 tax return filings, collecting a database of transaction records and states of assets, preventing tax evasion. Well, with bitcoin there are complete records of all transactions. That's the sort of thing it is haha.

Sankei has written that the conservative opinion leaders are  increasing in their numbers.  Conservative (large C) is not conservative.  A conservative is different from groups who want extreme changes to our society.  The Conservatives supported by Sankei are reformist groups.  What these groups are saying is 'Things are getting bad, but its not society's fault, its yours'. These Conservatives want things to remain the same to escape reality, which is different from being truly conservative. \\n

That is made up.” A Democratic congressman says, “no, he did say it.” A Republican congressman says, “I do not have any memory of that.” The Panama ambassador says, “I cannot decide if I can work under this kind of president.” This year is the midterm elections so the media is using all their strength to attack Trump since the new year, using the shithole comment and tell all books. However, I think the Republican Party will win.
1852	国連「トランプは人種差別主義者」トランプ「shitholeとか言ってないし、でっち上げ」民主党議員「いや言ってただろ」共和党議員「ちょっと記憶にないんで…」駐パナマ大使「こんな大統領の下で働けるか辞めるわ」  何で「不潔な場所」って訳すんだ？「糞の穴」じゃないの？	UN: 「Trump is a racist」Trump: 「I didn't say "shithole", and it's all a fabrication.」A democratic representative 「No, you definitely said it.」 A republican representative 「I can't seem to recall....」The panama republic ambassador 「I'd quit if I have to work under such a president」.  Why do they translate it as an 「unclean place」? Isn't it 「Shithole」?

4217	国際政治学者三浦瑠麗さん「世論に安全保障を論じる土壌がないので、多くの官僚は自分の担当期間中に工作船が自爆沈没したり、武器が見つかってもなるべく事なかれ主義で処理するようになる」 スリーパーセルは隠蔽されているってことかな  ベルリンの壁やソ連が崩壊したとき「愛する体制維持のために これまで築いてきた生活と財産を棄てて、コイツら迫撃砲でドッカン皆殺したるんやー」と蜂起した奴が果たしていたかどうか…国際政治学の先生に聞いてみたい。  むしろ起こったのはユーゴなどでおきた民族同士の無意味な虐殺であって、その行為は１００年経とうが双方に傷痕を残し続けるだろう。   そんな行為が正当化される訳がないわけで、加害に加わった多数派側の国際社会における信頼はどうなる。   「ニホンヲオトシメルタメノカツドウ」をしてるのはどっちかと思うのだけど。	Mr. Rui Miura, international political scientist "Since there is no soil that discusses security in public opinion, many bureaucrats are deadly suicidal during the period of their own handling, so that even if weapons are found, "Sleeper Cell is hidden When the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union collapse" I have abandoned Dokkan with a mortar like Mr. Kotatsu who has abandoned the life and property we have built to maintain a loving structure Whether or not the uprising who played up "fulfilled ... I would like to ask the teacher of international politics. Rather what happened is a meaningless genocide between the ethnic groups who gave up in Yugoslavia, and that act will continue to leave scars on both sides for a period of 100 years. There is no reason to justify such an act, what will be the trust in the international community of the majority who participated in the harm. I wonder which way you are doing "Nippon Wo Otoshiru Tamenokatsudo".\\n\\n
631	国難突破解散。総理は確かにそう宣って選挙をした。しかし、国税庁長官が総理夫妻の権力の私物化の尻ぬぐいで逃亡犯のように逃げ回っている現実をみると、また日々国民の税務行政に対する信頼が失われているのを見ると、国難突破どころか国難はむしろ膨張している。今やはっきりした。総理こそが国難。   体は大人 頭脳は子供 その名は迷宰相コクナン！	The end of a National Crisis breakthrough. If I'm not mistaken, the prime minister said that and was elected. However, seeing now that the director of the National Tax Agency is covering for the Prime Minister's wife abusing her political authority, and the reality that he's now running around like a fugitive criminal, and seeing the average citizen loosing their faith in the tax administration, more than breaking through the national crisis, its more like it's expanding. Now I'm certain. The prime minister himself is the national crisis. Like a child in a man's body, thy name is the Prime Minister of National Crisis!

Does this appeal to the M, or the S customer base?  For those in the SM club, delighting in the perverse pleasure of being abused and put down by the queen would be easy to understand.  This is somewhat S in approach, so it is hard to understand how this perversion can be offset. \\nIf it is neutral, then the unpleasant face would not really be funny, it would be an apology with a droopy willy, which is not the same as being balanced. It is further complicated by not being anchored to the SM axis. Addendum: Is this for perverts? Its easy to see how it appeals to this kind of customer.

Japan's labor environment being poor is also an issue, but I wonder if it's more that the women aren't prepared to raise children. I was raised in Japan after it became poor, but the young newlyweds that I know aren't like that. You shouldn't act like the old women in their 40s and 50s who were raised back when Japan was flourishing who search for a rich husband. There are some "3K" (good academic background, high income, tall) bachelors out there, but there aren't many of them (the 3K bachelors actually out there either have bad personalities or are ugly). I think soon it will be commonplace for both husbands and wives to do both work and household chores and raising kids. If the situation regarding Japanese business isn't considered, the declining birth rate won't go away.

People are surprised by who he followed. Why only six people ,why doesn't he write all their names. Abe is following Toru Hashimoto, Shin Asad,a Mao Noda, Seiko Abe. What is important is that he is following Toru Hashimoto. Although two years have passed since he quit the representative of Ishinha, I understand why Abe like toru so much
3736	安倍晋三首相がインスタ始める。意外なあの人へのフォローに驚きの声「ビックリです」  写真は秘書とか周りの奴らで、投稿は一太だと思っちゃうよね、やっぱ	Prime Minister Abe Shinzo starts using Instagram.

If I were you I would not even have wanted to attend the National Assembly, with it being so hot for you.  With such a short attendance schedule I would not have been able to use this excuse, so would have to use some sort of political posturing as an excuse.  Is that the reason for avoiding it? There's a rumour on the 2nd floor that improvement in relations with China and Korea was part of a deal made with cabinet.  The number one must be the US.
367	安倍ちゃん、結局、ピョンチャン五輪に出席するってよ  平昌で6ヶ国協議やるからね   日本だけが対話のテーブルから降りてる状態だったから   挽回するには首相の出席しかないとこまで追い込まれてたんだろ   本来なら外相だろうけど今の河野は安倍の劣化コピーだし   大方麻生二階に断られたとかかな	Abe says he will eventually attend the Pyongchan Olympics, because the 6 country summit will be held at Pyongchan.  It was only Japan who left the negotiating table.  We were forced into getting the Prime Minister to attend as the only way to restore the damage.  Originally it would have been the Foreign Minister, but the present one, Ota, seems like an inferior copy of Abe.  He was refused on the 2nd floor of Okata Aso.

The previous label coined by Prime Minister Abe is 'poverty'  A tangled web between welfare protection and wage devaluation. Death from plagues, war and famine.

Well then. Abe, Asao, if you round up and expel all the cabinet ministers you put in office with your power I think it'd be a popular move. Also, just how upset is the populace? To be frank, I have a feeling they are more upset with Masuzoe hahaha. Maybe it's a difference in how things are reported?

The Prime Minister will skip a passage in his speech relating to free high school education. The ruling parties are, like, 'Oh so sorry, we'll add it to the minutes even if he doesn't read it out.'  That may be sufficient, but it all seems rather petty.

Go and look up in a dictionary what "records" actually means → The dictionary has been falsified... This might be the future we have in store. War becomes peace (earnestly pushing forward).

(I feel like I wrote something like this before, but) no matter how you slice it 90% is not the same as 100%. And with such an unusual rate the country really can't control things at all, rather it's that the country "is doing it knowingly". Things have already collapsed, but rather than doing anything fundamental they just employ stopgap measures and gloss over things. At this rate it won't be long before things are truly over.

She then continued to talk about her own experiences and said things like "Your teacher does it too". If the teacher were in her 40s or 50s then I can picture a comic with a virgin repeatedly saying it's gross. To respond to it seriously, the number of parents/guardians is double the number of students, and if even one of them is a landmine then this will become a problem. School teaching has become something like a sport of avoiding landmines, so a teacher who talks about her own sexual experiences should be criticized. (She might be a good teacher, but if even a single parent sees that as a problem then it's no good.)

The responses reflected the children's experience.  "Teacher, you are doing it too" etc. The teacher's home page shows too much overtime, and it is always zero.... When I was a student I always thought Saturday classes were a bother,  but from an assistant teacher's point of view, it is extra work with only 1000 yen for lunch money as compensation. To all the teachers who taught me well;  I'm really sorry.

555	コンビニおにぎり小さくなる？ 減反廃止にらみコメ高騰  普通に考えれば減反廃止→供給増→価格下落ですけどね   まあ皆がブランド米作りたがるから、というのは聞いてますけども  業務米は結構先がある分野のようで、二極化してくのかなあという感じもするけど   極ってのも変なんだけど、分化かな  牛丼には牛丼向けの、カレーにはカレー向けの、オノギリにはオニギリ向けの米種というものがあるそうで、外食産業と組んだ米生産という動きがあるそうです   単に業務米=安い米ではなくて、用途別に分化していくのかなと   まあ外食産業は米を買い叩く方ではあるのですが発注量は安定的ですので手を組む旨味もあるんじゃないかなと   この辺は一物多価な牛乳とはだいぶ様子が違うなと  中長期的には米の家庭消費量の減少トレンドが厳しいのでしょうね  お米サブレもよろしくね！	Are convenience store onigiri getting smaller? Rice prices are soaring to stop depletion. If you think about it with common sense, stopping depletion→increases supply→price is reduced. I've heard that everyone wants to make branded rice, but the rice business is a field that seems to have a future, and I have a feeling that it might become polarized. It's strange that it's so extreme, but maybe it's specialization. It is said that there is a type of rice that's suited for beef bowls to be used in beef bowls, one that's suited for curry in curry, one suited for onigiri in onigiri, and it is said that there is a movement for rice production in cooperation with the restaurant industry. To simply say rice business=cheap rice is not the case, and I wonder if it will become more specialized by its usage. Well, the restaurant industry tends to buy up the rice but the amount ordered is stable so there may be an advantage in joining hands. In this aspect the situation is pretty different from milk, which has varied pricing. In the medium to long term the trend of reduction in household rice consumption must be tough. Don't forget about rice sable cookies!

We asked the administrator Well, I definitely think that family situation makes difference. When you say university exam is fair, for example the current prime minister came from the extremely rich family yet he was too stupid to get into Tokyo University, Waseda University, or Keio University; on the other hand student from norbal family backgroun who went to normal school still has chance to get into Tokyo University. What I am trying to say, is that poor familu has a chance to turn things around. Well here this idea gets DV instead of UV though.

Replacing the jacket.  A 'Fujiko F' type design...  The primary school administration declined to comment. The illustrator who drew it said it is a copy.  Its more like eating with** TrePak** in typical Sano style. In common with the Sano style it has poor artistic merit.  Along with this poor artistry is a disproportionately warped sense of self worth. The person calls himself an art copier, but that is too complimentary.  The line is non existent and there is no love or feeling for the form of the original.  Generally the art copier is a genuine artist who has actually studied techniques in copying and become an expert.  That's not the case with someone like Itako.  And speaking of Itako, there are those who have studied the drawings of master cartoonists like Keiichi Tanaka, have mastered them, **and put their own special stamp on them**.  These artists create parodies that the Itako types don't understand, so that the world can laugh and cry at their creations.  They combine a love of the original with an unusual artistic sense to produce something new, ** reaching a stage where they no longer require Trepak to get them published.** So to summarise; they are not Sano types.

The illustrator who drew it says that as opposed to copying the style, it's a **tracing scam** and it's a typical eating Sano Group…. Poor drawing skills are common in the Sano Group. As well as poor drawing skills, they have a totally biased, distorted, and bloated desire for recognition. It is also biased to call them a fraud. What is fake about something that has a dead line and whose original can’t event get any love? With fake artists, poor drawing skills is the first thing, then painting techniques are **studied and easily taken**. That makes me feel like saying you are like Itako people. Speaking of Itako, be like Tanaka Keiichi and study the style of a master cartoonist and get it yourself. There are definitely some people who are (**turning to your own shame**). Although the Itako cartoonist draws a nonsensical parody and publishes it to the world, making them laugh or frown, they are have the original paranoid love, mixed with abnormal drawing skills and good sense which holds it together (there's no longer a need to announce **arrival to a domain that does not need tracing scams**) so I that I can have a glance. They are not the Sano Group.

"Love for our country" included for first time. I though that what is important with history is to "use the events of the past to provide teaching that is relevant today", but it's somehow unpleasant, and there are things like culture and ideology, and looking down on arts colleges without even providing any money, saying they should love their country like this is a contradiction. Teaching so that people love, isn't that called brainwashing?

She was threatened to keep her mouth shut. Tokyo’s immigration authorities have a horrible refugee policy.

1690	なぜ日本人は賃貸自由主義より35年ローン地獄を選ぶのか	Why do Japanese people prefer a 35 year loan hell to living a loan free lifestyle.
1678	なぜ日本人は賃貸自由主義より35年ローン地獄を選ぶのか  欧米とは気候（湿気）が違うから，同条件では語れんと思う。手入れ悪いとコンクリだってバンバン腐るし。下手にリフォームするより建て替えの方がカネかからないケースだって多い。現状それで回ってしまってるからな。買う側も新築信仰がすごいし。  もっとも，おっしゃるように使える建物を壊してしまうのは実際勿体ないし（MOTTAINAIとか口先ばっかやな），我が国がビンボーになれば（規定の事実）否応なしに使い回さざるをえんと思う。	Why do Japanese people choose the hell that is a 35 year loan over the freedom that comes with renting? Compared to the West the climate (humidity) is different, so I don't think they can be considered in the same way. Speaking of tough maintenance, even concrete falls apart with time. There are even numerous cases where it is cheaper to rebuild than it is to remodel. That's what the present situation is. People who buy houses and those who believe in building new ones are amazing. Taking a usable building and destroying it is truly wasteful (of course the word "wasteful" is mere lip service), and if our country becomes poor (foregone conclusion) then whether we like it or not they'll have to be reused.

It is because it is much easier and safer to be an employee than to be an entrepreneur. I'm a son who's father was an entrepreneur, so you can believe me. Startups are easy paths for those with nothing to lose or who are already rich. There are turnarounds in life, but things do not turnaround with a single action. That is something worth remembering.

Right now the hospital is trying to get me to lose weight since I'm sick. They explained to me that walking for 30 minutes a day (it doesn't have to be all at once, it can be combined) is good for you. Walking is considered aerobic exercise, and apparently you can lose weight if you continue with it. But in the end, you have to somewhat limit your diet too or else there aren't noticeable results. Today after I did exercise therapy at the hospital I ate a big bowl of ramen on the way home, and it was really meaningless.

When strawberries are frozen they lose a lot of their color and when they are thawed they get soft, so they need to be handled as fresh, but then the ones that aren't sold have to be disposed of at a huge loss, so you need to estimate double the actual price and if you don't sell them for about triple you can't turn a profit.

3756	昭和天皇独白録を落札した高須克弥氏 「国の宝を取り返さないといけない」と理由を語る  ・独白録はヒロヒトの元側近（私人）のメモで、天皇が書いたものではないし国の宝とかでもない  ・メモを書いた寺崎英成の妻はアメリカ人で、相続した娘がアメリカ在住だったからアメリカで見つかった  つまりもともとアメリカにあったもので「海外流出」したわけではない  ・独白録は史料としての価値はあるが、メモ原本自体はそこまで価値のあるものではない（だから個人で買えた）  ・すでにその内容は文春文庫から出版されていて、日本中の誰でも読める	Takasu Katsuya wins monologue of Emperor Hirohito at auction, says the reason is that "national treasures must be recovered". The monologue is a memo from close associates (private friends) of Emperor Hirohito, it isn't something the Emperor wrote, and it isn't a nation treasure. The wife of the writer of the memo Terasaki Hidenari was American, and their daughter lives in America, so it was discovered in America. So basically it was something that was in America from the start and it isn't the case that it was "taken overseas". The monologue does have historical value, but the original memo itself isn't really all that valuable (that's why an individual was able to purchase it). The contents have already been published by Bunshu Bunko, and anybody in Japan can read them.

3741	景気が良ければ株価は上がるけど株価が上がれば景気がいいとは必ずしもならない	If the economy is going well then stocks go up, but just because stocks go up you can't say the economy is going well.
3741	いざなぎ景気を超える好景気と言われるのに、実感が湧かない理由	People talk about the good times with the Izanagi economic boom, but there's a reason it didn't feel that way.

Robbery, making off with with something, market manipulation, shirking payments.... Since those are light crimes or things that you aren't worried about people finding out, if you were to take out those kinds of people then it would be paradise.
547	これ暗にいっしょに狩り行こって言ってるだろ	It's said it's hunting in the dark.
1337	暮らしに「ゆとりなくなってきた」	My standard of living is 'declining'.
1110	暮らしに「ゆとりなくなってきた」 日銀調査で回答増加  国策として原発を推進したいのは政府なり省庁なのだが（総発電量の7割以上は商工業用（住宅用が約3割だが店舗兼住宅を含むので））   原発事故の発生確率を0%にすることが出来ない以上は遅かれ早かれ起きるに決まっており   この対策として間接的に民間の電力会社と重電メーカーにやらせる二枚盾作戦をとっているのだろう（これなら事故の責任は自分達の方に来ないし最悪切り捨てればよい）   なぜそう思うのかというと電力会社は発電に何を使おうがコストを電力料金に上乗せすれば良いだけなので大きいリスクを背負う理由が無いからです	There is less and less elbow room in livelihood: the answers from Bank of Japan's survey continue to grow. The ones that want to purport nuclear power as a national policy is the government and their offices. (Overall, over 70% of electric power is used for business (and about 30% is for homes, but that includes homes that are also businesses.)) You can't completely lower the probability of a nuclear accident to 0%. Sooner or later it's going to happen. As a counter measure against this, they are indirectly allowing the private electric companies and makers of heavy electrical equipment do it as a two shield strategy. (If this is the case, we won't be the ones to take the blame for an accident and and at the worst it will be omitted.) The reason I think this is if the power companies raise the electric fee for using the generators for whatever they are used for then they'll be fine and there is no reason to take on big risks.

4027	ヤンキーが暴力を振るうのは、他者の表情を読み取れていないからである  恐怖と驚きは一般人よりDQNの方が正解率高いんだなぁ	Yankee wields violence because fear and surprise which is because the expression of others can not be read is higher than that of ordinary people by DQN is higher rate of accuracy
3456	ヤンキーが暴力を振るうのは、他者の表情を読み取れていないからである  それはある   殴る教育の建前は「他人の痛みを教える」だが実際に憶えるのは「殴れる側が正しい」だ	The reason a delinquent will raise violence against another is because they cannot read the facial expressions of others.  A certain punching lesson might be "Teaching others pain", but what really leaves an impression is "Thee side that is able to strike is right".
3604	「暴力やめて」訴えても…殴る蹴る、児童に体罰２年  死刑で  こいつのせいで学校嫌い勉強嫌いになったら人生滅茶苦茶になるよ  体罰は殺人と何ら変わらない	Even if you say "stop the violence"... Hitting and kicking, giving corporal punishment to children, two years, death penalty, because of this if kids come to hate school and hate studying it'll mess up their life.

I said as I cried myself to sleep. Toyama's costume character rejected a cash on delivery product. Just change from doing COD to paying in advance at a convenience store so they can't have a reason to take legal action. Ah, old people. Like idiots, they shoved their money into the national identification number system. It would be great if they could just settle this by paying with their pension money.

3072	｢最上級に豪華｣として載ってるしじっさい最上級に豪華だと思う	But it's rated "The highest level of splendor" out of borderline foods, so i think it's actually the highest level of splendor.
1594	ネスレ最低だわｗ	Nestle is the worst, haha.

1659	最多は月19回！｢遅延の多い路線｣ランキング  総武線が1位って中央線の遅延なんかも総武線で調整してんだろうな。小田急が5位って納得。ホントに頻繁に遅延してるわ。  総じて、過度な経費抑制（特に人件費）のための整備不良のせいってのが増えてんじゃないの？	The most was 19 times in a month! Ranking of "train lines that are most often late". The Sobu Line being first is probably because when the Chuou Line is late the Sobu Line has to adjust. I'm not surprised that the Odakyu Line is fifth. It really is late all the time. All together, aren't there more cases where excessive cost cutting (particularly for personnel) is blamed for inadequate maintenance?
1797	最大10GbpsのFTTHサービス「auひかり ホーム10ギガ」、3月1日受付開始。俺のPCのLANの100倍の速さなんだが  通信ってのは相手があっての話だからな、相手が遅けりゃ結局遅い   ツィッターだってしょっちゅう糞詰まって何も流れてこなくなるだろ	The FTTH service with a maximum of 10GBps 「auひかり ホーム10ギガ」will be available for order on 3/1.  It's 100 times faster than my PC's LAN, but communication is only good with a partner, and if your partner is slow then the communication will still be slow.  Even Twitter sometimes clogs up and nothing flows on the feed, right?
341	最大野党が解党に追い込まれていたため全議席を与党が獲得	The ruling party gained all seats because the largest opposition party was driven to extinction.

207	最も所得が低い階層への所得再分配、日本は米国並み水準か	An income redistribution aimed at the class that make the lowest income, is Japan on the same level as America?
654	最も所得が低い階層への所得再分配、日本は米国並み水準か  日本の場合米帝みたいに寄付の制度とか弱者同士で救済するコミュニティみたいなのが脆弱すぎるから  米帝並の所得再配分だったとしても末端は米帝より悲惨な生活を強いられてそう	An income redistribution: the most earnings will be redistribution to the lower class. Does Japan have the same standard as the USA? In Japan's case, the reason they do things like setting up a US imperial style contribution system or have a community where the disadvantaged people help other disadvantaged people is because they're too fragile. Even if they distributed the earnings like the US imperialists do, it looks like the extremities would be forced to have a miserable life, more so than US imperialism.

Let's all chat together! On Darkest Dungeon I had a huge wipe with three characters dying and it killed my motivation, so I started playing the Zelda BotW DLC. The rehabilitation was going without a problem, and suddenly it was the part where you either die or kill in one hit and it was hilarious. I kind of headed in the direction of Mipha, and once again realized how truly amazing this game is. While moving north I kept thinking "Ah! I need to catch some armored carp!" Ah! I need to grab some fleet lotus seeds!" and getting strongly lured in, and I really felt like, "This is BotW." The Shield Breaker is really garbage and I won't use it again (warning).

Flipping it over is tedious, but there is definitely a worldview that can only be achieved through a record.

The only one I need is green, so I should have the full set sometime this week. The union event is approaching as well, so the dock expansion is under review. I don't really care about how it looks, but is this going to get discarded? There's a limit to how much you can equip and reduce and it's getting scary how tight the inventory is.

The Union Event is also coming, so I'm considering expanding my dock. For outward appearance I personally don't care all that much, but can I just throw this away? There is only so much you can equip and decrease, and my inventory is so packed that it's scary.

At this point, the pros and cons have shown themselves and it makes me want to talk to others about it.  I think of things like, I would have shaved this portion off if the previous leader, Miyamoto was still in charge (Is the Odyssey ship even necessary?) or other things like, it's really something to marvel at this day and age that even though we can capture this many things, the controls aren't too shabby.  Just like Zelda: BotW, it's a game where you can just sense the change of staff when playing.

Privately owned is not the same as foreign investment. This is a good opportunity for general contracts to come in. With risky business and Japanese businesses it comes down to membranes and the furnishing of materials. They are bad at actually making products.

"A 5 year old boy placed his genitals in the mouth of a 4 year old girl". "At home the father watched adult videos and violent videos". Even if they are kids, a male is a male, and they must not forget that they are an invader receiving special education from a male dominated society. Problematic sexual behavior in children. As part of the background, girls also masturbate from a young age, and just like boys (not in any deep way) they mess around, so even if that isn't recognized by feminist thoughts it's still there.

A dead dog is not a dog. It's meat in the shape of a dog." When a beloved pet dies is it "burnable garbage"? There are crematoriums for pets. There are also funerary urns and cemeteries. Some people also have them stuffed. Others have their ashes or hair turned into diamonds and wear them. Even people, when they die, are just meat. If when a pet dies you have no problem thinking of it as garbage then it should be the same for a person. Of course if people are treated as garbage then there's the issue of corpses just being abandoned.

In Sweden, a law has been established that takes into account the viewpoint of women who become victims.

If you take a photo of the agreement then does that mean you can rape as much as you like? That law doesn't really advantage women.

3300	浮気したことある人への質問  勿論日本でも普通ではない…   只明治迄は多妻制が認められていた訳だし、国民の大多数がキリスト教とかイスラム教という訳ではないので、貞操観念が少し薄いのかも。   イスラムは多妻制だけど、知り合いの人は結婚するまで女性に触れないって事で普通のマッサージ受けるのにもわざわざ男性を指名していたが、そういう宗教的厳格さが無いせいかもしれない。	Here is a question for people that have \\ncheated (on their spouse or sweetheart). \\n\\nOf coarse it is not common in Japan either. However, polygamy was recognized in the Meiji Period. Most Japanese people are not Christian or Islamic so the chastity issue might be a little looser. Islam is polygamous but one cannot touch a female until marriage. Even when having a massage, a Muslim will ask for a male. Japan does not have that kind of a strict religious mindset.

Professional patriots who call the Asahi Shimbun fake news and use the internet to seek its abolition, why don't you protest in front of the Asahi Shimbun if you hate it so much? Did you arrive at the answer yourself? It's because they're not amateurs, but "pros". With their ideology, if they say it's not moving, do you understand? They pretend to be a Red Guard, but they are not a Red Guard.

I think either way it is self defense. The population is shrinking and the number of people who use yen is decreasing, so that will have a huge impact on the public amount of expenditure that goes toward exchange. So regardless of whether the yen gets stronger or weaker, isn't having assets that aren't tied directly to the yen a perfectly sound self defense strategy?

"If it is not changed it will be an impediment to people returning and revitalization." This is because the decision is deemed necessary considering the decontamination and whether or not it is at a safe level for people to live. It's not because it's a problem, right? If external exposure via an accident can cause sudden death when a substance is laid bare, then with that substance entering the body and causing internal exposure, can't that also carry a risk of death? "Radioactive material is exposed in the demon core and exists in the area around the reactor, and just by drawing near you can die via external exposure, so the area should be designated as dangerous just taking into account the external exposure. Also, in that case you would die from external exposure before you died from internal exposure, so it cannot be thought of as a place you can die from internal exposure." Something like that. "Unrelated to any need for decontamination or for any decontamination base level in Fukushima, the area in which there is a substance which can cause sudden death through just external exposure cannot be deemed safe." If that is the claim, then what you are saying is correct. That makes perfect sense.

"If they are not improved then they will be a hindrance to people returning and the rejuvenation of the area." For this, with the decontamination levels in Fukushima, the decision is based on whether or not it is a safe place to live. It's not because it's a problem, right? Due to the accident, items which can cause instant death due to external exposure were uncovered, so it seems likely that if those items entered the body there'd be a high likelihood of death from internal exposure. "Radioactive material was uncovered from the demon core, and it exists in the vicinity of the reactor, and just by drawing near you could die due to external radiation, so it should be designated as a dangerous area just in terms of thinking about external exposure. In this case, before one would die of internal exposure they would die of external exposure, so the area cannot be deemed deadly in terms of internal exposure." "For decontamination base levels in Fukushima, regardless of whether they are necessary for decontamination, areas where there are materials that can cause instant death due to external exposure cannot be called safe." If that is what they mean, then what they are saying is correct. It's exactly right.

This is a reality of modern Japan.  I heard this when I went to the local tax office for a consultation during a half holiday. I asked about the framework for miscellaneous income, and whether miscellaneous income needs to be added in the profit or loss total?   I then went on to ask about bitcoin trading.  Let's say I bought bitcoins (on the summit of Inago tower) for 10,000 yen, and these were going down in value.  When I checked their value at years end,  these had gone down to 7000 yen, meaning a loss of 3000 yen.  Can this loss be offset against other miscellaneous income?  I was told that it could.  Addendum:  Sorry, I got it wrong.  This was about foreign currency with a foreign currency trader. If the foreign currency exchange  is on the FX, then the Japanese FX officials will calculate profit and loss accounts for all transactions at the JPY conversion rate.  However, for transactions in foreign virtual currency, this thoughtful action is not possible.

Win7 has a share of 46.63% and Win10 29.26%; I would think "going well" would mean "reaching the target of operation on 1 billion machines in three years", and based on it only being used on 600 machines at present, it seems likely that this goal will be failed. I'd guess that MS wouldn't want a headline saying that Win10 is failing, so we ended up with this misleading title

Moritomo report issue.  There is a difference between partial and total collapse.  If the doctoring of the report was allowed, then this is a total collapse, unless the country is run by some strange groups.  Because, even if you don't have a single yen, you can be taxed. If you receive tax you can say you didn't. There's also the question of the disappearing pension money.  Its like it's allowed in some countries.  In order to get over this, then we need to accept the abnormal situation where everyone thinks they were not cheated, no matter how much is taken.

Until 1958, prostitution was legal in Japan. But that doesn't mean that before that all men were paying for prostitutes. Men that went were clearly divided from men that did go. Men that didn't go were ridiculed for being "tasteless" and "unsociable." It is absolutely no different from the story that is linked.

It wasn’t like me. Expression and sexual harassment is different.” Even if Denstu becomes a good company and being an advertising company they still look down on people,  all the corporate companies are not good so I dont care.

The Prime Minister's reaction to the opposition parties in a 'working parliament'.  I watched this, and it was awful.  Everything he mentioned was totally wrong.  All sorts of fabricated data used as an excuse.  What ever it was, it wasn't a dialogue. With this kind of person as Prime Minister, he will be sucking up to Dentsu together with the media,  and we won't know what he is thinking about.  When he amends the constitution this will lead to discretionary labour and conscription as well. I'm not as young as I used to be, but I don't want that kind of world, so I will oppose the Abe administration constitutional amendments.

If we can not deal with the former regulation, we must find a way to tame a new company If profit shifts to another place, we must also change tax collection methods

Saying that "this country makes me happy" and recklessly treating the public opinion like that, this person is scatterbrained. If it's natural to have the freedom to give birth, you're free not to give birth as well. Kids that are born don't get to choose their parents.

What does this have to do with direction or preference? This isn't just someone talking in their sleep. The problem is that children, who are weaker than adults both physically and in social ability, could suffer. The experiences one has while maturing having a lasting impact on the rest of one's life.

There must have been a rule that a go player competing against an AI could borrow the working PC with the AI before a match without compensation. The player can use that to find the tendencies or weak points (this is like a really strong despair), and the AI creators are forbidden from making any changes from the point it is given until the end. If they can find a bug that gives them a 100% chance of victory, then it's like the human wins without an actual contest.

Additionally, as the birthrate declines the labor force dies ↓ * Promote patriotism and love for one's hometown and make it harder to go abroad * Make changes so that property rights can be limited to an extent.

Is the chant to appeal to North Korea’s threats? The result has been direct meetings which is the exact opposite of Prime Minister Abe’s rhetoric.

I feel sad when I hear laughter, and I feel lonely even when I am smiling.  I suffer from tinnitus, and recently my chronic migraines feel like a hammer is hitting me from inside my skull.  I don't have the guts to kill myself.  I am just tired of suffering.  Unavoidable G Words.
